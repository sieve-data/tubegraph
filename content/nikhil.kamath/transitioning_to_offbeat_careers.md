## Early Life and Influences

### Kriti Sanon's Journey
Kriti Sanon describes herself as a shy, studious, and nerdy child, experiencing the pressure of being the firstborn to excel in academics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Her mother was a professor and her father a Chartered Accountant, fostering an environment focused on high grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite her shyness and stage fright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, she started learning Kathak at age five, though she initially disliked the classical form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Her mother, who had to fight for her own education and career, recognized Kriti's talent and pushed her to develop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Kriti pursued engineering, genuinely liking computer science and physics, despite her mother's concerns about the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

### Rahul's Upbringing
Rahul grew up in Mangalore, a small town, where both his parents were professors – his dad in geology and his mom in Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>. He developed a love for cricket at a very young age, picking up a bat at two and a half or three years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. Rahul was a decent student but excelled in sports, playing every sport available in his school, which he believes contributed to his overall athletic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. His parents, though supportive of his cricket aspirations, maintained strict conditions about his academic grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.

### Badshah's Background
Born in Delhi, Badshah's father worked a government job in the Delhi Electricity Board, and his mother was a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>. He attended Bal Bharti Public School and later St. Stephen's College before pursuing civil engineering at Punjab Engineering College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>. He started with Punjabi music and Bollywood, but was introduced to rap in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:35">[01:45:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:49">[01:45:49]</a>. He was working as a subdivisional officer for BBMB (Bhakra Beas Management Board) in Himachal Pradesh, operating water canal gates, when he began his music journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:02">[02:09:02]</a>.

## [[Challenges and experiences in traditional and nontraditional career paths | Challenges and Growth in Unconventional Careers]]

### Overcoming Personal Hurdles
Kriti initially struggled with stage fright and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. Her first ramp show and photoshoot left her crying due to consciousness and the pressure to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. She gained confidence by repeatedly putting herself in uncomfortable situations, learning from experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

Rahul, a self-described shy and soft-spoken boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>, found confidence through playing for India, but a public interview that led to suspension left him scarred, making him less outgoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:37">[01:28:37]</a>.

### Navigating Industry Dynamics
All three guests came into their respective industries without family legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. Kriti noted it took her a decade to reach her current standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. They discussed the unique challenges:
*   **Acting**: Difficulty finding good scripts and working with specific directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. External perceptions of "not enough" or "not fitting the role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Bollywood's statistical downturn and changing profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.
*   **Cricket**: While talent is key (nature vs. nurture debate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>, Rahul highlights that athleticism and diverse sport experience can be a differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. He also notes that personal relationships or niceness have no bearing on being picked in cricket; performance is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>.
*   **General**: The public enjoys seeing people in power fail, and celebrities must [[overcoming_challenges_and_personal_stories_in_careers | outlive criticism]] to become legends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:25">[01:30:25]</a>. Rahul believes in detaching from public opinion and maintaining focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>.

## Strategies for Success

### The Role of Passion and Skill
The guests emphasize that passion is often developed after discovering one's talent and excelling at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>. Kriti fell in love with acting after starting it and realizing her capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:10">[02:15:10]</a>. Badshah stresses that if the "want" is a genuine love for music, one should pursue it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:17">[02:13:17]</a>.

### Continuous Learning and Adaptability
A key factor for success in these fields is the ability to constantly learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>. Kriti embraced being a "learner," asking many questions on set, even when it was initially perceived as negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. She advises asking questions without shame and with curiosity to gain answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

### Persistence and Mindset
Jay-Z's quote, "The only genius thing that I did was not giving up," resonates strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:37">[02:13:37]</a>. Persistence is crucial, especially in the face of initial failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.

Rahul suggests maintaining a mindset of not worrying about the outcome in sport, as this can lead to better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>. He also emphasizes the importance of balancing ambition with gratitude, reminding oneself of one's beginnings to stay grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>.

### [[Social media career transitions | Navigating Social Media and Public Scrutiny]]
Rahul has taken a break from actively engaging with Instagram for the past year and a half to deal with trolling, emphasizing that "if you don't know what are you trying to deal with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13">[01:33:13]</a>. He advises young people to consume social media but not go too deep into it, prioritizing real life over online validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.

### The "Cool" Factor
The discussion touches upon the "aura of coolness" and enigma that often surrounds successful figures. Kriti believes that intelligence, wit, self-deprecating humor, and charm contribute to being cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:42">[02:24:42]</a>. Conviction and not second-guessing oneself are also considered cool qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:29">[02:26:29]</a>.

## Personal Philosophies and Advice

### Defining Happiness and Peace
Kriti defines happiness as being at peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:33">[02:20:33]</a>. She also describes being in a "happy restless phase," where she is content with her current position but driven by ambition to evolve and explore new challenges without insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:28">[02:21:28]</a>.

### The Role of Relationships
Rahul believes relationships are vital for stability and focus, offering a "safe space" away from external pressures and keeping one grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:29">[02:31:29]</a>. Badshah, however, found relationships distracting from his higher purpose and chose to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:41">[02:30:41]</a>.

### Longevity and [[Retirement and future work culture | Future Planning]]
All three acknowledge the finite nature of their careers, especially in sports, where a peak is typically reached by age 40 for international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:13">[02:16:13]</a>. Kriti notes that actresses must evolve their roles with age, avoiding being "stuck in a particular zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>. Badshah states that for a musician, age is not a barrier to staying relevant, but continuous evolution is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:57">[02:21:57]</a>.

Rahul began investing in businesses during COVID-19 to ensure financial security post-cricket, as he anticipates a significant dip in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:05">[02:19:05]</a>.

### Advice for Aspiring Individuals

*   **For Musicians/Producers**:
    *   Start by learning production basics via YouTube tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:10">[02:12:10]</a>. Equipment can be minimal (laptop, midi, speakers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:38">[02:12:38]</a>.
    *   Be original and authentic, as every person is as unique as their DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:32">[02:35:32]</a>.
    *   Have conviction in your unique story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:11">[02:36:11]</a>.
    *   Patience is the biggest virtue, both in making it and staying successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:26">[02:36:26]</a>.
    *   Cultivate a "dog in you"—the drive to outwork competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:54">[02:36:54]</a>.

*   **For Aspiring Entrepreneurs**:
    *   Avoid industries crowded with "passionate people" or those that are "cool" today, as they tend to be expensive and hard to compete in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:35">[01:48:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:49">[01:49:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>.
    *   Focus on sectors with strong tailwinds (e.g., energy transition, health/wellness) that are projected to grow significantly in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:18">[02:38:18]</a>.
    *   Research the sector thoroughly before building a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:44">[02:38:44]</a>.
    *   Be realistic about project viability: if something isn't gaining traction within two years, reconsider and be willing to pivot or abandon it quickly to avoid wasting time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:30">[02:39:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:03">[02:40:03]</a>.
    *   Leverage India's current economic climate and the "proximity advantage" for local entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:36">[02:40:36]</a>.

## Impact of Cultural Background on Career Choices
The discussion touches on the [[impact_of_cultural_background_on_career_choices | influence of cultural background]] and upbringing. Kriti's mother's competitive nature stemmed from her own experiences of fighting for education and a career in a conservative family environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>. Similarly, Rahul's parents, being academics, instilled the importance of education alongside his passion for cricket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. These personal stories highlight how family values and societal expectations can shape an individual's career trajectory and motivation.

## Choosing Work for Personal Fulfillment
Kriti emphasizes that her work brings her a sense of being "alive" and she loves the daily variety of her acting career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. Her current goal is to find amazing scripts and work with directors she hasn't had the chance to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>. This aligns with the idea of [[choosing_work_for_personal_fulfillment | choosing work for personal fulfillment]], where the intrinsic joy and challenge of the work itself become the primary drivers, rather than solely external factors like money or fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>.
