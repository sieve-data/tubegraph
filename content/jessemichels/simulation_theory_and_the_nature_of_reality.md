From: [[jessemichels]] <br/> 

The idea that reality might be a simulation has become "pious and conventional" in modern discourse, with prominent figures like Elon Musk suggesting it's highly probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This notion often stems from a sense of postmodern nihilism, where society feels purposeless, domesticated, and hypnotized by material gain, leading to a belief that "nothing matters, go crazy, it's all just a video game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The post-pandemic era, with its accelerating changes like [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] and global conflicts, serves as a "forcing function" to confront the uglier aspects of ourselves, possibly signaling that the simulation is "breaking" and we are glimpsing a light beyond Plato's Cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Origins of the Simulation Idea

The concept of a computer-programmed reality has roots in science fiction, championed by authors like Philip K. Dick and William Gibson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. However, it gained academic prominence with Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom's 2012 book, *Superintelligence* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Bostrom's core thesis suggests that as human technology advances, particularly in virtual reality and [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]], the creation of virtual worlds indistinguishable from our own becomes possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Given the historical arc of technological progress, it's argued that we should expect the creation of high-fidelity virtual realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. In a future world, whether resource-constrained or abundant, opting into brain-machine virtual simulations might become more pleasurable than physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Scientific Arguments for a Simulated Reality

Riz Virk, an MIT and Stanford-educated computer scientist and video game entrepreneur, takes Bostrom's theory further, pointing to phenomena in physics that suggest reality is based on [[role_of_technology_and_science_in_understanding_reality | information theory]] or quantum code, rendered by humans in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Finely Tuned Physical Constants
Physics appears to be perfectly constructed to create the conditions for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Stephen Hawking noted that the fundamental numbers in the laws of science, such as the electric charge of an electron or the ratio of proton and electron masses, seem "very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Water**: The unique bonding of hydrogen and oxygen allows ice to be less dense than liquid water, preventing Earth from flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Fundamental Forces**: Slight changes in Planck's constant or the strong nuclear force would drastically alter the formation and stability of elements essential for life, like hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Gravitational Constant**: A different gravitational constant could prevent Earth from retaining its atmosphere or drastically shorten the sun's lifespan, precluding life's formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Earth's Magnetic Field**: The Van Allen belt, created by Earth's magnetic field, protects life from cosmic radiation while allowing enough solar radiation for genetic mutations necessary for evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Growing organic life in a Faraday chamber, which removes natural electromagnetic frequencies, demonstrates their necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

While conventional academia views these as happy accidents, thinkers like Riz Virk argue they point to intelligent creation or simulation, suggesting that our universe is merely one run in a "simulated Multiverse" where constants are fine-tuned for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Information Theory
The universe displays patterns consistent with [[role_of_technology_and_science_in_understanding_reality | information theory]], the basis of computer and video game code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>:
*   **Repeating Structures**: Nature exhibits repeating patterns like the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden Ratio (approximately 1.618), found in DNA dimensions, leaf arrangements, and spiral galaxies, resembling reusable code or "infinite Russian nesting dolls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Binary Nature**: The basis of [[role_of_technology_and_science_in_understanding_reality | information theory]] involves bits (ones and zeros). In nature, particles like electrons have matter-antimatter pairs (electron and positron), suggesting a binary "on/off switch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Human DNA, with its two base pairs (A-T and C-G), also mirrors this binary structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

### Quantum Mechanics
[[Quantum mechanics and its implications | Quantum mechanics]] offers further parallels:
*   **Rendering on Demand**: In 3D MMO RPGs, only observable elements are rendered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This aligns with [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum indeterminacy]], where particles exist in superposition until measurement or observation, a concept known as "lazy evaluation" in computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
*   **It From Bit/Qubit**: Physicist John Archibald Wheeler, a proponent of [[role_of_technology_and_science_in_understanding_reality | information theory]] as the basis of physics, coined "it from bit" and "it from qubit," suggesting physical reality arises from a base substrate of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. His later conclusion was that a particle is simply "an answer to a series of yes no questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Probability and Multiple Runs**: The concept of probability requires multiple occurrences (like rolling a die multiple times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. If quantum probability waves collapse to a single outcome, it implies the existence of multiple "runs" or universes where other possibilities play out, as suggested by Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. If the universe is information/computation, cloning a physical universe would simply mean cloning information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.
*   **Fermat's Principle of Least Time**: Light follows the path of least time, suggesting algorithms that seek the most efficient outcomes, akin to how rendering works in a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

## Consciousness and Perception within the Simulation

Our senses act as a filter, limiting our perception of reality to prevent our brains from being overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman argues that perceiving the true nature of reality might not always be adaptive for survival; instead, our senses evolved to provide high-level, efficient abstractions (like seeing "red" instead of a 650nm wavelength) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. These are like "application icons on a computer screen," allowing us to navigate, not understand the underlying source code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.

### The Role of Mind in Wave Function Collapse
Early proponents of [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]], including Heisenberg, Max Planck, John von Neumann, and Eugene Wigner, entertained the idea that the mind was involved in the collapse of the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. Even Erwin Schrödinger, developer of the wave equation, stated that [[Quantum biology and consciousness | consciousness]] is "absolutely fundamental" and cannot be accounted for in physical terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. John Archibald Wheeler believed in a "participatory universe," where observers affect the outcome of experiments, challenging the subject-object separation foundational to traditional science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

Nobel Prize winner Roger Penrose's theory of Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR) suggests that within the brain's microtubules, spacetime itself exists in superposition, and [[Quantum biology and consciousness | consciousness]] arises from the gravitational collapse of this superposition, allowing for [[philosophical_views_on_existence_and_different_realities | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. If reality is a computation, Penrose and Wheeler's ideas imply that [[philosophical_views_on_existence and_different_realities | free will]] and intention drive that computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

### Consciousness as a Network and Intuition
The idea of a "client side" (humans) and "server side" (larger network) could explain [[Quantum biology and consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. When one person learns a new concept or has a breakthrough, it might make it easier for others to achieve similar insights, akin to Rupert Sheldrake's morphic resonance or the "Banister effect" in athletics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. This suggests that scientific and material accomplishments are "uploaded to a central repository," making it easier for others to download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. The human body's electromagnetic field, potentially linked to an extended version of electrodynamics, might be how we "call information from the larger field or server" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

Intuitions and gut feelings might be "future memories" or "clues" from the future, guiding us towards optimal timelines that have already been "run" in the simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. This suggests that human evolution involves optimizing timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.

## Anomalies and Glitches in Reality

The concept of a simulation helps explain phenomena that challenge our understanding of a singular, objective reality:

*   **Mandela Effect**: A phenomenon where a large number of people collectively remember events that contradict actual reality (e.g., Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the 80s, or specific movie quotes being misremembered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>. This is presented as a "consensus collapsing function" or a "glitch in The Matrix" where a variable was changed in the simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>.
*   **Changing Scripture**: Instances where religious texts seem to have changed, despite being memorized word-for-word by devotees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. One Sufi Imam suggested that entities called Jin, who don't live in normal space-time, can change physical objects but not human memory, explaining why memorization was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Philip K. Dick's Experiences**: Philip K. Dick believed that his novel *The Man in the High Castle*, depicting an alternate history where Germany and Japan won WWII, was a real timeline that simulators decided to "rerun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>. He also experienced a mundane reality change (a light chain becoming a switch), which inspired his book *The Adjustment Team*, suggesting the existence of "timeline manipulators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.
*   **Parapsychology and Random Event Generators**: Experiments at the Princeton Engineering Anomalous Research (PEAR) lab, using random event generators (REGs) tied to quantum processes, show statistically significant evidence that human intention can skew binary outputs (ones or zeros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. This suggests a "dialogue" between the human mind and [[role_of_technology_and_science_in_understanding_reality | information processing]] machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. Although scientifically controversial due to a lack of a clear causal mechanism, the effects are robustly observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This phenomenon implies that the internal state of the observer matters for what is observed, leading to "air pockets of different consensus realities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

## Breaking Out of the Simulation

The concept of breaking out of the simulation is explored through both technological and spiritual means.

### High Energy Physics and Reality Disruption
Physicist Ken Wilson's concept of renormalization suggests that at higher energy levels, deeper structures of physical laws emerge, stripping away superficial details to reveal fundamental interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. This raises questions about nuclear weapons testing, which involves extreme energy output, potentially "ripping holes in the fabric of reality" or changing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>. The colossal energy of devices like the Tsar Bomba, and especially hypothetical energies capable of folding spacetime, could get to the "root information layer of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

This might explain why [[alien_encounter_and_its_influence_on_understanding_of_physics | UFOs]] often appear around nuclear blasts, as documented by Robert Hastings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. These [[alien_encounter_and_its_influence_on_understanding_of_physics | UFOs]] (or "intelligently moving green Fireballs") may be "hyperobjects" existing outside our simulated reality, appearing when the fabric of the simulation is stressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. The idea that [[alien_encounter_and_its_influence_on_understanding_of_physics | UFOs]] can materialize/dematerialize and skip across time suggests they have access to the universe's information substrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. Similarly, high-voltage experiments by Thomas Townsend Brown, which were funded by quantum gravity pioneer AGN Bohnson, were thought to have implications for time travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. Anecdotal accounts from CERN physicists even speak of "beings from portals coming in and out" due to high-energy collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. These high-energy outputs may lead to "deeper layers of reality, deeper levels of ontological truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.

### Spiritual Technologies and Altered States
Ancient traditions worldwide feature methods to transcend the perceived illusion of reality, often described as a "veil" or "Maya" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. These "spiritual technologies" involve inducing altered states of consciousness through practices like sensory deprivation, fasting, meditation, breathing techniques, and sometimes drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. The consistent reporting of similar mystical experiences across diverse cultures (e.g., Jewish Merkabah mystics, Indian yogis, Buddhist monks) suggests an objective reality beyond the veil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. The common goal is to "break the servitude of soul to the body" and liberate the spirit, aligning with the idea that the body is a "container" or "prison" for a primordial soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>.

> "The body is kind of like a container, almost like a prison, like our soul has like fallen from this very rich, dynamic, extra-multi-dimensional world, and we're kind of like stuck here in this like limited fallen world of death." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>

Many traditions describe the soul ascending through various "heavens" or "palaces," encountering "Celestial Gatekeepers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. These accounts are strikingly similar to modern Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) and psychedelic experiences, where individuals report visiting places "more real than real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. NDEs, particularly "life reviews" that are holographic and experienced from others' perspectives, suggest that every event of our lives is "recorded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

## [[philosophical_views_on_existence_and_different_realities | Philosophical Views on Existence and Different Realities]]

The **simulation theory** offers a powerful metaphor for [[conceptualizing_reality_and_perception | understanding reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>. Ancient traditions, using metaphors like "the world is a dream," "the world is an illusion," or "the world is a stage," align with modern simulation concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. The Hindu concept of Maya, meaning "the power of illusion," suggests we "suspend disbelief" to enjoy the "show" of this world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>. Some Islamic traditions even describe this world as an "enjoyable delusion" or a "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.

### The RPG Version of Simulation Theory
One interpretation, called the "RPG version" (role-playing game), posits that humans are not merely non-player characters (NPCs) but avatars of "more primordial souls" who voluntarily enter this "low-level reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. This perspective, drawing on Plato's Myth of Er and the concept of anamnesis (forgetting one's primordial self upon entering the body), is seen as more "life-affirming" as it grants real agency within the simulated world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27">[10:27]</a>. Choosing a difficult "quest" or "storyline" in life might indicate a "higher level player" opting for "hard mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.

### Avoiding NPC Mode and Embracing Consciousness
[[Quantum biology and consciousness | Consciousness]] and intention appear to be entropy-reducing, attracted to order rather than chaos, a concept known as centropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>. This suggests [[Quantum biology and consciousness | consciousness]] drives evolution and must be preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>. However, if humans fail to remain conscious and exercise their "divine right," they risk being taken over by the computer program and becoming a "non-player character" (NPC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:46">[01:23:46]</a>. Dr. McCarthy, a founder of [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]], told a story about a man whose predictable behavior led the "Bureau of Simulation" to replace him with a simulated human, even as the man continued his life, unaware of his replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

In a modern world increasingly obsessed with material things and low-level virtual simulations, the article suggests that if our universe is a simulation, we should focus on "breaking out of it and into a higher realm by contemplating and exercising virtue" instead of escaping into digital worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>. As Erwin Schrödinger concluded, "Atman equals Brahman" – the individual soul is identical to the universal soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.
