David Park successfully scaled his [[successful_ai_applications_and_startups | AI startup]], Jenny AI, from zero to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He attributes this growth to a comprehensive marketing playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This playbook covers paid ads, SEO, and influencer marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Park's strategy focuses on repeatable tactics that can be implemented by other startups to achieve similar growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His approach to [[building_and_scaling_an_ai_startup_from_zero_to_10m | growth]] was initially detailed in a viral post titled "How to go from Zero to $5 Million ARR Profitably Step by Step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Organic Short-Form Content & Influencer Marketing

Organic short-form content is a highly effective, low-cost [[user_acquisition_and_marketing_strategies_for_ai_products | marketing strategy]] for [[utilizing_ai_in_startup_growth | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### The "Fresh Account" Advantage
Modern social media platforms like TikTok do not heavily prioritize an account's history or follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Founders can create a new account and have a video go viral immediately if the hook and content quality are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This means a fresh account with few followers can outperform an established account with millions of followers in terms of engagement and views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. David Park states that he would "unironically sponsor a fresh account made this week versus a YouTuber with a million Subs if they had similar views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, primarily because fresh accounts often benefit from algorithmic boosts and are significantly cheaper to sponsor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Creating Your Own Accounts
Instead of sponsoring new accounts in your niche, you can create them yourself by having a creator act as the "face" of your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This allows the creator to educate viewers about your product's pain point solutions and offer helpful advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This approach avoids the creator "polluting" their main account with ads and offers a cost-effective way to get similar viewership over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. It's often easier to convince a creator to make 30 videos on a new account than to do 30 sponsored posts on their main one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

#### Case Study: Ming Duck
Jenny AI partnered with Ming Duck, paying him $4,000 per month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Ming Duck, who had 300,000 followers on TikTok, became the face of a new Jenny AI account starting from zero followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This account subsequently grew to 70,000 followers and achieved approximately half a billion views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. In the first month, they garnered 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. A single video with a million views can add thousands in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) depending on conversion rates and audience targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The payment for 20 videos might seem high, but creators can often produce these videos in 5-10 minutes a day by focusing on new hooks and using pre-supplied product screen grabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

### The "Order of Virality" & Viral Series Strategy
The goal when working with creators is to find a "viral series" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. Humans are creatures of habit and prefer to see similar content that resonates with them repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Once a video goes viral, the next step is to turn it into a repeatable series by tweaking the execution while maintaining the core appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

The "Order of Virality" lifecycle:
1.  **Farm Multiple Accounts**: Instead of one account per platform, manage multiple accounts on each platform (e.g., TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. At its peak, Jenny AI had seven accounts on each platform, posting 24 videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
2.  **Experiment Extensively**: Experiment with numerous hooks, video ideas, and different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Post one or more videos daily to increase testing velocity and identify winning content angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. This methodical experimentation helps find "mega bangers" with millions of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
3.  **Identify Viral Video**: After enough experimentation, a video will go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
4.  **Turn into a Series**: Convert the viral video into a repeatable series by making minor tweaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. Jenny AI's "POV: You have a paper or an essay due" series, featuring a character realizing an essay is due, generated over 300 million views by using the same setup and resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. This one series alone generated half a million dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.
5.  **Scale Series Across Accounts**: Post the tweaked series on multiple accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
6.  **Translate for International Markets**: Create the same video with creators speaking different languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
7.  **Sponsor Reposts on Other Pages**: When a series reaches the tail end of its organic virality, sponsor other pages (like Instagram meme pages) to repost the viral videos, giving them a "second life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
8.  **Use for Paid Ads**: Leverage mega-viral content for paid advertising campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
9.  **Return to Step One**: Eventually, copycats will emerge, and the series will become played out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. At this point, return to farming hooks and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

### Format-Product Fit
It's crucial to have a "format-product fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Going viral for the sake of virality is "empty calories" if it doesn't align with your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. A video that garnered 20 million views for Jenny AI had a negligible effect on conversions because it lacked this fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. The content must attract people who genuinely want to use or convert to your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

## Finding Influencers

The most effective way to find relevant influencers is to ask your current users who they follow, especially those related to your product's niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Their actual follow lists reveal who truly influences them, not just creators with large follower counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

### Algorithmic Discovery
A powerful "hack" for finding influencers is to create a new Instagram or TikTok account, manually follow the initial list of relevant influencers, and watch their videos all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. The algorithm will then automatically suggest other similar influencers, allowing you to discover "craziest steals" – new creators with amazing content who are likely to go viral soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. Sponsoring an influencer whose video appears on your "For You" page (without you following them) indicates that the platform's algorithm is already pushing their content to a broader audience, increasing your upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

## Reaching Out to Influencers

When reaching out:
*   **Use All Avenues**: Utilize DMs, emails, LinkedIn, and even older platforms like Tumblr if you can find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. The harder it is to find their contact, the more impressed they might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
*   **Be Detailed & Concise**: Messages must be tailored and detailed, but also concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Demonstrate Enthusiasm**: Show that you are a genuine fan of their content and excited about a partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Explain Mutual Benefit**: Articulate why they should partner with you and why their audience will love your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.
*   **Highlight Paid Promotion**: Clearly indicate that it is a paid promotion from the outset to differentiate from offers of free products or subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Expect Low Response Rates**: Assume most will not respond initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. Developing thick skin helps optimize outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. As your product gains recognition, it becomes easier to secure partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

## Negotiating with Influencers

Align incentives by not paying the entire amount upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. Splitting payments, with a percentage tied to conversions (via coupon codes) or views, ensures both parties are motivated for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. Be transparent about your budget and expected ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

A negotiation tactic is to ask for the most expensive package first (e.g., full usage rights, link in bio, cross-platform posts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Then, systematically remove elements you don't need or find too expensive, tailoring the deal to your specific requirements until you reach a fair price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. This method helps discover the true, non-inflated price of a single video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Once a fair single-video price is established, negotiate bulk deals (e.g., three videos per month at a discount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. It's important to **never pay based solely on follower count**, as this is often misinformation and leads to poor ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

## Posting Content

A one-size-fits-all strategy won't work because each influencer has a unique audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Sponsored content should not deviate significantly from the influencer's usual posts to maintain audience retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. If inexperienced, trust the influencer to create content similar to their usual posts, merely integrating your product at a specific timestamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. Ideally, your product can be naturally inserted into an influencer's existing popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI Tools") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.

To scale [[user_acquisition_and_marketing_strategies_for_ai_products | influencer marketing]], you need to move away from micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. Provide influencers with a clear blueprint on how the product should be discussed and portrayed, expected views/engagement, and then allow them autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. This "set and forget" approach, where you buy package deals for monthly videos, is crucial for scaling efficiently with a small team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. Don't be afraid if your video looks like a "straight-up ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>; while it might get fewer views, it will convert better because it directly addresses a user's pain point and solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

SEO should **not** be the initial [[marketing_strategies_for_ai_applications | growth strategy]] for early-stage startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>. It offers delayed gratification and takes a long time to generate traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Influencer marketing and User-Generated Content (UGC) can provide orders of magnitude more immediate traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

### Key SEO Tactics
*   **Featured Snippets**: Target pages with featured snippets. By creating the "perfect answer" to a query that has a featured snippet, you can often leapfrog many lower-ranking spots directly to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   **Increase Brand Name Searches**: Running influencer and UGC campaigns often leads users to search for your product's name directly on Google (rather than clicking in-app links) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This increases brand name searches, which passively boosts your legitimacy in Google's eyes without direct SEO work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
*   **Focus on High-Intent Keywords**: Prioritize ranking for keywords that indicate strong buying intent (e.g., "best [your tool's function]") rather than low-intent keywords like "free [your tool's function]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.
*   **Advanced Strategies (Later Stage)**: At later stages, with a steady income, companies can invest heavily in SEO, including making mini-tools, free tools, and landing pages in different languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. Jenny AI even acquired an SEO agency to make them an in-house team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

## Paid Ads

Paid ads, like SEO, can be a "trap" for early-stage entrepreneurs due to slower iteration cycles and the need for significant upfront investment in learning phases and creative development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. Many startups get stuck in unprofitable cycles with paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.

### Leveraging Organic Success for Paid Ads
The benefit of doing UGC and influencer marketing first is that you gain content that organically resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. This content can be repurposed for paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. Data from social media partnerships (e.g., which countries convert best, LTV per country, ideal user types) provides valuable targeting information for paid ad campaigns from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>. Jenny AI only invested heavily in paid ads after achieving some level of product-market fit (PMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>.

### Metrics and Strategy
Jenny AI aims for a 3:1 LTV:CAC (Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost) ratio and a short payback period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. They aim to make their money back from a user within the first two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This quick payback allows them to funnel money back into the best-performing acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

## Lessons from Scaling from $5M to $10M ARR

The core strategies outlined above remain applicable even when scaling from $5 million to $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. However, scaling requires improvements in hiring and team building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

Additional growth levers used for later-stage scaling:
*   **Affiliate Marketing**: A significant portion of Jenny AI's later revenue came from affiliates who champion the product and earn a cut of conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions**: Jenny AI began acquiring other startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. They acquired one startup when it was at $500k ARR and doubled its revenue in five months by applying lessons learned from Jenny AI, leading to increased conversion rates, improved retention, and reduced churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Back to Basics: Retention & Conversion**: With increased traffic from various distribution channels, a major focus was placed on improving the core funnel – specifically retention and conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. Jenny AI reduced its churn rate from 20% to around 9-9.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. Reducing churn significantly impacts growth, especially at larger scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. High churn (e.g., 50% monthly) is common for B2C [[utilizing_ai_in_startup_growth | AI tools]], so achieving single-digit churn is a major accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.

Ultimately, successful [[user_acquisition_and_marketing_strategies_for_ai_products | growth marketing for AI products]] requires a blend of creative approaches (working with artistic creators) and analytical rigor (tracking data, managing campaigns, optimizing ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Building genuine relationships with creators and continuously iterating on strategies are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
