This article explores the practical application and success of sales funnels, drawing insights from Jonathan Courtney's experience building a $20 million funnel. It highlights the distinction between websites and funnels, presents various types of successful funnels, and discusses their applicability across different business verticals.

## What is a Funnel?
A funnel is defined as a step-by-step process designed to convert a stranger or non-customer into a paying customer [00:03:15]. This differs significantly from a website, which serves more as a brochure or a place for browsing, like a grocery store, without a focused path to conversion [00:03:32]. Websites are often considered "shadow funnels," primarily existing to prove a company's legitimacy rather than to directly generate sales [00:04:35].

[[differences_between_websites_and_sales_funnels | Websites and funnels]] operate as completely separate projects, with distinct URLs and teams [00:04:58]. While websites prioritize visual design and user experience, funnels focus on compelling copywriting and [[increasing_conversion_rates_with_funnels | conversion optimization]] for a specific flow [00:10:23].

> [!info] Conversion Rate Comparison
> A typical website converts only 1-3% of visitors into customers, meaning approximately 98% of visitors don't perform the desired action [00:11:03]. In contrast, funnels can achieve conversion rates of 10-25%, significantly impacting business growth [00:11:34].

## Examples of Successful Funnels

### The $20 Million Video Sales Letter (VSL) Funnel
Jonathan Courtney detailed a single "ugly" VSL funnel that has generated over $20 million in revenue in its lifetime [00:05:05], [00:32:35], [00:32:49].
This funnel is characterized by:
-   **Initial Traffic Source** Targeted Facebook (Meta) or YouTube ads [00:17:53].
-   **Focused Landing Page** A page "full to the absolute brim with copy" [00:19:37] and a single call to action [00:19:44]. The design is intentionally non-aesthetically driven, often looking "dreadful" but proving effective for conversions [00:15:43], [00:30:38], [00:31:52].
-   **Free Training Video** An "obnoxiously long" 1-hour to 1-hour 10-minute video training that provides substantial value and showcases expertise [00:20:12], [00:21:47], [00:23:15]. The button to book a call only appears after viewers have watched a certain portion of the video (e.g., 15 minutes) [00:22:16].
-   **Email Capture and Drip Campaign** Viewers are encouraged to provide their email to access the training, allowing for a drip-feed email campaign that continues to nurture the lead [00:24:24], [00:24:31].
-   **Friction-Increasing Survey** When lead flow is high, a survey is added before the call booking to qualify leads and prevent wasted time on low-quality calls [00:34:43]. This survey includes questions about current work, desired help, commitment levels, and investment capacity [00:35:13].
-   **Limited Call Booking Window** Calls can only be booked three days in advance to ensure people join when they are most interested and engaged [00:36:47].
-   **High-Ticket Conversion** The ultimate goal of this funnel is to book sales calls for high-ticket programs, which can range from $5,000 to $14,000 per participant [00:09:02], [00:28:01]. This funnel also unexpectedly generates significant corporate training and agency leads, with one lead resulting in a $300,000 training session [00:38:36], [00:39:04].

### YouTube Funnel
YouTube channels can be monetized by directing viewers to specific funnels. Rather than having multiple calls to action, the goal is to send people from educational content to a single, focused funnel [00:42:01], [00:42:40]. For example, a 36-minute workshop video directs viewers to a link in the comments, which leads directly to the VSL funnel [00:41:02], [00:41:16].

### Lead Generation Funnel (Lead Magnet)
This type of funnel is designed for lead capture and lead nurturing.
-   **Simple Landing Page** A basic landing page, created quickly (e.g., 20 minutes in ClickFunnels), offers a valuable resource (like a template) in exchange for an email address [00:44:30], [00:45:36]. These pages often lack formal branding and exist on separate URLs, reinforcing the distinction from the main website [00:45:46], [00:45:57].
-   **Email Drip Campaign** Once an email is collected, a series of pre-written emails are sent to gradually warm up the lead and introduce them to the company's offerings [00:46:50]. This drip campaign can eventually lead them to a sales call or segment them for other campaigns, such as Black Friday deals [00:47:37].

### Blog/SEO Funnel
Content marketing efforts, such as blogs, can be effectively monetized by linking them to a dedicated funnel [00:49:15]. An SEO-optimized blog with an "unbranded" or separate URL can funnel visitors directly into the main, high-converting funnel [00:49:18], [00:49:35].

### Book Funnel (2K Funnel)
A highly effective, though logistically complex, funnel involves offering a physical book, often at or below cost price [00:50:09], [00:51:37].
-   **Physical Product Appeal** People are highly motivated by the offer of a physical book, more so than digital content, despite the widespread availability of free information [00:51:01], [00:54:47].
-   **Upsell and Free Training** After purchasing the book, customers are presented with an immediate upsell (e.g., a €2,000 course) or a free training video that summarizes the book's content and leads into a sales pitch [00:52:50], [00:53:59].
-   **Marketing and Liquidation** The book itself generates buzz through social media shares [00:51:50]. The initial sale can help liquidate the costs of Facebook ads, with subsequent upsells driving profitability [00:53:35].

## Applicability of Funnels

Funnels are effective for almost any situation where the goal is to turn a stranger into a customer [00:25:50], including:
-   Software companies [00:25:27]
-   E-commerce businesses [00:25:12]
-   Agencies seeking high-ticket projects [00:27:46]
-   Businesses selling training (in-person or online, to corporates or individuals) [00:27:21]

> [!warning] When Funnels Might Not Be Ideal
> Funnels may be less suitable for:
> -   Businesses focused on extreme prestige (e.g., Michelin-star restaurants) [00:26:20].
> -   Large corporates with significant funding that can rely on branding or large sales teams [00:26:47].
> -   Businesses unwilling to run ads or with no existing marketing list/experience [00:28:51].

## Key Takeaways for [[building_a_successful_sales_funnel | Building a successful sales funnel]]

-   **Focus on Conversion, Not Aesthetics** Don't prioritize a "nice" design over effective copywriting and a clear, focused path to conversion [00:15:43], [00:30:38]. Often, "shittiest looking funnels" are the most profitable [00:30:40].
-   **Direct Response Marketing** Embrace direct response marketing techniques, including urgency and clear calls to action, which are used by many successful brands (e.g., Eight Sleep, AG1) [00:56:05].
-   **The MIFGE Concept** Implement a "Most Incredible Free Gift Ever" (MIFGE) by stacking one-time free gifts onto an offer to dramatically [[increasing_conversion_rates_with_funnels | increase conversion rates]] [00:56:19], [00:56:43]. This can be applied even to high-ticket B2B deals [00:57:31].
-   **Urgency and Scarcity** Use limited-time offers and urgency to drive immediate action [00:58:24].
-   **Single-Minded Goal** Ensure all content and marketing efforts direct traffic to one primary funnel, and all teams share a single metric (e.g., filling a sales calendar) [00:42:43], [00:43:36].
-   **Testing and Iteration** Continuously A/B test elements within the funnel to optimize performance [00:31:18].
-   **Learn from Others** Analyze competitors' funnels using tools like Facebook Ads Library to understand what works in your industry [01:01:20].
