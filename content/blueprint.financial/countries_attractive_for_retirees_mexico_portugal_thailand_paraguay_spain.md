## Retirement Abroad: A Solution for Canadians Escaping High Costs

A significant number of Canadians, approximately 106,000, permanently left the country in 2024, not solely for sunshine, but to escape high costs, high taxes, and the fear of outliving their [[financial_strategies_for_maintaining_retirement_funds_abroad | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many are choosing to [[reasons_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | retire abroad]] to stretch their money further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Living in Canada is expensive, especially for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. However, in 2025, this amount may not be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. For example, a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto averages about $2,100 per month in rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Adding utilities ($200), groceries ($400), and a transit pass ($150) brings the modest monthly living cost to over $3,000 for someone who doesn't own a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. CPP and OAS combined barely cover a third of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Numbeo data suggests a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, bringing total modest living costs to $3,500-$4,000 per month with a one-bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This highlights the need for [[cost_of_living_comparisons_for_retirees_in_canada_vs_other_countries | smarter options]], such as [[reasons_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | retiring abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto vs. Abroad

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

#### Seth in Toronto
*   **Annual Spending**: $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Income**: $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS, with the rest from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: By age 70, he drains his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals ($46,000+ annually), incurring tax rates above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. By age 74, he's out of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, and by age 76, his net worth turns negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. His [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | costs]] were too high for his savings to sustain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Attractive Countries for Retirees

Canadians seeking to [[reasons_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | retire abroad]] often prioritize locations with lower [[cost_of_living_comparisons_for_retirees_in_canada_vs_other_countries | cost of living]], good healthcare, pleasant weather, and accessible travel options. Numbeo is a useful tool for comparing living [[cost_of_living_comparisons_for_retirees_in_canada_vs_other_countries | costs]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

#### Mexico
Mexico is a top choice for Canadian retirees due to its warmth, affordability, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild spring-like weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and fast private clinics are a major draw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Dental work can be about 20% of the price in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees and typically requires about $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from most major Canadian cities make visits easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs**: Safety concerns vary by region, infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, bureaucracy requires patience, and some Spanish language skills are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Private health insurance is essential as public healthcare isn't usually available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living (Cancun)**: Numbeo data indicates a single person renting a one-bedroom spends about $1,700 CAD per month all-in, or about $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   **Seth's Outcome in Cancun**: With lower living [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | costs]], CPP and OAS cover most expenses, requiring only small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. His portfolio grows, reaching $387,000 by age 70, $586,000 by age 80, and over $900,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This illustrates how location can transform [[financial_strategies_for_maintaining_retirement_funds_abroad | retirement finances]] from running out of money to building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

#### Portugal
For those preferring a laid-back European lifestyle, Portugal offers old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and relatively affordable [[cost of living comparisons for retirees in Canada vs other countries | costs]] for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle & Weather**: Mild winters, sunny summers, with the Algarve offering nearly year-round beach weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. Porto and Lisbon are cooler and breezier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent healthcare; residents can access the public system, and private care is also affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, designed for those with steady income from sources like CPP, pensions, or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. It requires about €870 per month, or $1,400 CAD, to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Farther than Mexico, but Lisbon and Porto offer direct flights to Toronto and Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: Portugal falls between Canada and Mexico in terms of [[cost of living comparisons for retirees in Canada vs other countries | cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. In cities like Porto, rent might be around $1,300 per month, with other expenses totaling about $1,700, leading to a monthly total of around $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. This is similar to the lower end of Canadian [[cost of living considerations for Canadian retirees | retirement spending]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Seth's Outcome in Portugal (Porto)**: Spending about $36,000 a year, with $300,000 in savings and $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. He draws from TFSA then RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. By age 75, savings drop to $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, over $100,000 by 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, and by 84, he's out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. While better than Toronto, it wasn't enough for a long-term plan (e.g., to age 90) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

#### Thailand
Thailand remains one of the best value retirement destinations for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Offers diverse regions from cooler mountains (Chiang Mai) to beaches (Phuket, Hua Hin) and energetic cities (Bangkok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Features a well-developed expat scene, rich culture, and incredible food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and widely regarded as some of the best in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. Many doctors speak English, and private hospitals often exceed expectations for the [[cost of living comparisons for retirees in Canada vs other countries | cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
*   **Visa**: To qualify for a retirement visa, one must be 50 years or older and show 800,000 Thai Baht (about $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living (Chiang Mai)**: A full lifestyle, including rent, food, and leisure, can range from $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. For someone like Seth, receiving $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, this could cover most basic needs, allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

#### Paraguay
Paraguay is an emerging destination, appealing for its low [[cost_of_living_comparisons_for_retirees_in_canada_vs_other_countries | costs]] and tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Taxes**: Paraguay operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions is not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living (Asunción)**: Expect to spend about $628 per month on living expenses, with a one-bedroom rent around $583 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. This means living well on just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Offers ways to obtain a permanent residency visa with minimal hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Advantage**: For Seth, Paraguay could be a financial sweet spot due to its very low [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | cost]], tax efficiency, and simple long-term settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

#### Spain
Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents like Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living (Alicante)**: Numbeo data indicates monthly living [[cost_of_living_comparisons_for_retirees_in_canada_vs_other_countries | costs]] around $1,570, with rent for a one-bedroom in the city center at about $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. This brings total monthly expenses to $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>, which is close to or even cheaper than some parts of Canada and Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, requiring about $40,000 to $45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. This is a higher bar, but potentially achievable with [[financial_strategies_for_maintaining_retirement_funds_abroad | planning]] (e.g., earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: Spain offers a higher-end lifestyle, strong infrastructure, great weather, and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

### Critical Considerations for Retiring Abroad

#### Old Age Security (OAS) Rule
Canadians risk losing [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_abroad | OAS payments]] if they [[reasons_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | retire abroad]] without meeting a key rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
*   **Residency Requirement**: If applying while living in Canada, only 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 are needed to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. However, if living outside Canada, 20 years of residency are required to keep receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
*   **Example**: David, with 15 years of Canadian residency, moved to Thailand after starting OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. His OAS stopped after 6 months because Thailand doesn't have a social security agreement with Canada, and he didn't meet the 20-year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] OAS Payments
> Make sure you know the [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS rules]] before you move or risk losing income you've earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.

#### General Advice
*   **Research [[cost of living comparisons for retirees in Canada vs other countries | costs]]**: Use tools like Numbeo to compare rent, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
*   **Diversify Income**: Do not rely solely on CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. Inflation, currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare expenses can derail your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipate Challenges**: Life abroad isn't for everyone; distance from family, new systems, and language barriers can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive [[financial_strategies_for_maintaining_retirement_funds_abroad | Planning]]**: A low-cost retirement can be amazing, but only if backed by a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. Moving abroad also involves complex [[tax_implications_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax rules]] and significant [[factors_influencing_retirement_decisions | financial decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.
