A significant number of Canadians, approximately 106,000 in 2024, are choosing to permanently leave the country, with many seeking to [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | escape high costs, high taxes, and the fear of outliving their retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This trend includes a growing number of retirees looking for a more affordable and comfortable lifestyle abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Why Canadians Are Retiring Abroad
[[cost_of_living_comparison_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | Living in Canada is expensive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP and OAS]] if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This amount is often insufficient to cover basic expenses, especially in major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For example, a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto averages about $2,100 per month in rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. With additional costs like utilities ($200), groceries ($400), and a transit pass ($150), monthly expenses can easily exceed $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Numbeo estimates that a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, and with a $2,000 one-bedroom rent, the total can reach $3,500 to $4,000 monthly for modest living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

This high [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | cost of living]] means that for many, [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP and OAS]] barely cover a third of their expenses, leading to a feeling of running on a treadmill in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As a result, many Canadians are delaying retirement or seeking smarter options abroad where their money can stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### The Financial Challenge in Canada: Seth's Example
Consider Seth, who retires in Toronto in 2025 at age 65 with $281,000 in net worth after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He plans to spend $50,000 a year, relying on $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS, with the rest from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   By age 70, he drains his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals, over $46,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Effective tax rates creep above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   By age 74, he's out of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   By age 76, his net worth turns negative, a nightmare scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

This simplified example shows how quickly a decent nest egg can unravel in a high-cost city like Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Top Countries for Canadian Retirees

### Mexico
Mexico is a top choice for Canadians seeking warmth, affordability, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

*   **Climate**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild spring-like weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and fast private clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Dental work can be significantly cheaper (e.g., 20% of Canadian price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, requiring about $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Convenient direct flights from most major Canadian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs**: Safety concerns vary by region. Infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, and bureaucracy requires patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Basic Spanish helps, and private healthcare insurance is essential as public healthcare is not usually available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

**Seth's Retirement in Cancun**: If Seth, with $300,000 in savings, moved to Cancun, his financial outcome changes drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. A single person renting a one-bedroom in Cancun spends about $1,700 CAD per month all-in, totaling about $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. With much lower living costs, his CPP and OAS cover most expenses, requiring only small investment withdrawals.

*   At age 70, he has $387,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   At age 80, he has $586,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   By age 90, he has over $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This demonstrates the "potential power of location" in retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Portugal
For those preferring a laid-back European lifestyle, Portugal offers old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and relatively affordable living for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

*   **Climate**: Mild winters, sunny summers. The Algarve has beach weather nearly all year, while Porto and Lisbon are cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent system; residents can access the public system, and private care is affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, designed for those with steady income from CPP, pensions, or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It requires about €870 per month ($1,400 CAD) to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Farther than Mexico, but Lisbon and Porto offer direct flights to Toronto and Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Portugal's cost of living falls between Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

**Seth's Retirement in Porto**: In Porto, rent might be around $1,300 per month, with other expenses at $1,700, totaling about $3,000 per month ($36,000 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is similar to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending.

*   With $300,000 in savings and $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS, Seth covers the rest by drawing down his TFSA then RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   By age 75, his savings drop to $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   By age 80, he's down to just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   By age 84, his savings are depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

While Portugal offered a better runway than Toronto, it wasn't enough to sustain Seth's retirement to age 90, which is often recommended for [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | financial strategies for Canadian retirees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

**Small Adjustments to Seth's Plan**: If Seth delays CPP to age 70 and melts down his RRSP from age 65 to 69 to cover the gap, it lowers taxes early and allows CPP to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This one move extends his savings by two years, making them last until age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Further adjustments, like working an extra year, trimming spending, or earning money from a hobby, could turn "close" into "comfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Thailand
Thailand remains one of the best value retirement destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

*   **Lifestyle**: Options range from cooler mountains (Chiang Mai) and beaches (Phuket, Hua Hin) to the energy of Bangkok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. It offers a well-developed expat scene, rich culture, and incredible food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and widely regarded as some of the best in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Many doctors speak English, and private hospitals often exceed expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Visa**: To qualify for a retirement visa, one must be 50 years or older and show 800,000 Thai Baht (about $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle, including rent, food, and leisure, can cost $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. For someone like Seth, bringing in $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, this could cover most basic needs, allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay
Paraguay is an emerging destination, particularly appealing for its tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

*   **Tax System**: It operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions is not taxed at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Asunción, living expenses can be around $628 per month, with a one-bedroom rent at about $583, totaling just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Paraguay offers ways to obtain a permanent residency visa with minimal hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Financial Sweet Spot**: For Seth, Paraguay could be a financial sweet spot due to its very low cost, tax efficiency, and simple long-term settlement process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Spain
Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

*   **Healthcare**: Excellent healthcare, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,057, with a one-bedroom rent in the city center at about $1,300, bringing total monthly expenses to $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This is comparable to, or slightly cheaper than, some parts of Canada and Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, which requires about $40,000-$45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This is a higher bar but achievable with [[financial_strategies_for_canadian_retirees | financial strategies]] like earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: Offers a higher-end lifestyle, strong infrastructure, great weather, and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Retiring Abroad

### Impact on Canadian Benefits: OAS Payments
A critical rule for Canadians retiring abroad is the OAS payment requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   However, if you're living outside Canada, you need 20 years of residency to continue receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving, unless you're in a country with a [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | social security agreement with Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

**David's Example**: David, 67, with 15 years of Canadian residency, starts collecting OAS in Calgary then retires to Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Six months later, his OAS stops because Thailand does not have a social security agreement with Canada, and David didn't meet the 20-year mark for living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This highlights the importance of understanding the rules to avoid losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### General Advice for Retiring Abroad
*   **Cost Comparison**: Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs for rent, food, and utilities in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Financial Planning**: Do not rely solely on CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Account for inflation, currency shifts, and unexpected healthcare costs, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Personal Considerations**: Life abroad is not for everyone. Be prepared for distance from family, new systems, and potential language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

A low-cost retirement can be amazing, but only if it's backed by a solid financial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Retiring abroad involves complex tax rules and big financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
