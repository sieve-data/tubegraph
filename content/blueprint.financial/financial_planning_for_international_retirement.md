A significant number of Canadians are opting to leave the country permanently in 2024, with 106,000 individuals making this move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many are driven by a desire to escape high living costs and taxes, as well as the fear of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Some are specifically choosing to [[retiring_abroad_to_stretch_retirement_savings | retire abroad]] to stretch their money further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The High Cost of Retirement in Canada

Living in Canada is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives approximately $1,300 to $1,500 per month combined from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This income, which might have sufficed decades ago, is often insufficient in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For instance, in Toronto, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is around $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Adding utilities ($200), groceries ($400), and a transit pass ($150) brings the modest monthly living cost to over $3,000, assuming no home ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. CPP and OAS combined barely cover a third of this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Numbeo data estimates a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, and with a $2,000 one-bedroom rent, total monthly costs are around $3,500 to $4,000 for modest living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

This financial pressure leads many Canadians to delay retirement or seek alternative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Living in Toronto, he spends about $50,000 a year, relying on $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS, with the remainder covered by RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The outcome for Seth in Toronto is bleak:
*   By age 70, his TFSA is drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals, over $46,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Effective tax rates creep above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   By age 74, he is out of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   By age 76, his net worth turns negative, a "nightmare scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
Seth's modest lifestyle in Toronto was unsustainable given his savings, leading to a rapid depletion of his nest egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Top Destinations for [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | Canadian Expats]]

[[retiring_abroad_to_stretch_retirement_savings | Retiring abroad]] allows Canadian retirees to make their money stretch further, transforming a bare-bones existence into a comfortable life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Mexico
Mexico is a top choice for Canadian retirees, offering warm weather, affordability, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle:** Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild, spring-like weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Modern, affordable, and fast private clinics are a major draw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Dental work, for example, can be 20% of the price compared to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Visa:** The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, generally requiring about $103,000 CAD in savings, depending on the consulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Travel:** Direct flights from most major Canadian cities make family visits convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs:** Safety concerns vary by region, infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, bureaucracy requires patience, some Spanish is helpful, and private health insurance is essential as public healthcare is not typically available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Seth's Retirement in Cancun
> If Seth from the earlier example were to retire in Cancun, his financial outlook would be vastly different. A single person renting a one-bedroom in Cancun spends about $1,700 CAD per month all-in, totaling about $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. With these lower costs, CPP and OAS cover most expenses, and only small investment withdrawals are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
> *   At age 70, Seth's portfolio grows to $387,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
> *   By age 80, it reaches $586,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
> *   By age 90, he has over $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
> This demonstrates the "potential power of location" in transforming a retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Portugal
Portugal offers a laid-back European lifestyle with old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and relatively affordable living costs for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle:** Mild winters, sunny summers, with beach weather nearly year-round in the Algarve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Porto and Lisbon offer cooler, breezier climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Excellent healthcare system, with residents able to access the public system. Private care is also affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Visa:** Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, requiring steady income from sources like CPP, pensions, or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Qualification requires about €870 per month (approx. $1,400 CAD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Travel:** Farther than Mexico, but accessible with direct flights to Toronto and Montreal from Lisbon and Porto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living:** Portugal falls between Canada and Mexico in terms of cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In Porto, rent might be around $1,300 per month, with other expenses around $1,700, bringing the total to about $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Seth's Retirement in Portugal
> If Seth chose Porto, his annual spending would be about $36,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. With $300,000 in savings and $18,000 from CPP and OAS, he would draw down his TFSA first, then RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
> *   By age 75, savings drop to $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
> *   By age 80, he's down to just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
> *   By age 84, his savings are depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
> While Portugal offers a better runway than Toronto, it's still not enough for a long retirement with $3,000 a month in expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

> [!TIP] Optimizing Seth's Portugal Plan
> Small adjustments can significantly improve [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | financial planning]]. If Seth delays CPP to age 70 and uses RRSP withdrawals from 65-69 to cover the gap, he lowers early taxes, maximizes CPP growth, and evens out withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This single move extends his savings by two years, running out at age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Further options could include working an extra year, trimming spending, or earning income from hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Thailand
Thailand remains one of the best value retirement destinations for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle:** Options include the cooler mountains of Chiang Mai, the beaches of Phuket, the energy of Bangkok, or the chilled vibe of Hua Hin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. It offers a well-developed expat scene, rich culture, and incredible food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Modern, affordable, and widely regarded as some of the best in Asia, with many English-speaking doctors and excellent private hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Visa:** To qualify for a retirement visa, one must be 50 years or older and show 800,000 Thai Baht (approx. $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living:** In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can range from $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. For someone with $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, this means basic needs are covered, and savings can grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay
Paraguay is an under-the-radar option gaining interest, not just for its low cost but also its tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Taxes:** Paraguay has a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions are not taxed at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living:** In Asunción, living expenses can be about $628 per month, with one-bedroom rent around $583 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This means a good lifestyle for just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Visa:** Paraguay offers ways to obtain a permanent residency visa with minimal hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Financial Benefits:** It presents a "financial sweet spot" due to very low costs, tax efficiency, and ease of long-term settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Spain
Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Excellent healthcare, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living:** In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,057, with a city center one-bedroom rent at about $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Total monthly expenses are around $2,400 to $2,500, comparable to some parts of Canada, but potentially cheaper than parts of Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Visa:** Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, which requires about $40,000 to $45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This is a higher bar, but achievable with careful [[financial_planning_for_retirement | financial planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** Spain provides a higher-end lifestyle, strong infrastructure, great weather, and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Key Considerations for [[financial_planning_for_canadian_retirees | Canadian Retirees]] [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | Retiring Abroad]]

### OAS Rule for Expats
A critical rule for Canadians [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retiring abroad]] concerns Old Age Security (OAS) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   However, if you are living outside Canada, you need 20 years of residency to continue receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving Canada, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

> [!WARNING] OAS Example: David in Thailand
> David, at 67, has 15 years of Canadian residency and starts collecting OAS in Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. When he retires to Thailand, his OAS stops after 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This is because Thailand does not have a social security agreement with Canada, and David did not meet the 20-year residency mark for receiving benefits abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Knowing these rules is crucial to avoid losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### General Planning Tips
*   **Research Costs:** Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs of living (rent, food, utilities) in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Don't Rely Solely on Government Benefits:** CPP and OAS alone are often not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Inflation, currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare costs, especially in developing countries, can significantly impact your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Consider Challenges:** Life abroad is not for everyone. Be prepared for distance from family, adapting to new systems, and potential language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Seek Professional Advice:** A low-cost retirement can be amazing, but only with a solid [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | comprehensive financial planning for retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Moving internationally involves complex tax rules and significant [[strategies_for_financial_planning_in_retirement | financial planning]] decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Professional help can map out costs, taxes, and "what-ifs" to prevent running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Tax Traps:** Watch for tax traps when leaving Canada to save thousands in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
