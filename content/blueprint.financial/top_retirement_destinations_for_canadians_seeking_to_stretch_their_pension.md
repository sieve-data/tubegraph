A significant number of Canadians, approximately 106,000, left the country permanently in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many are seeking to escape high costs and taxes, driven by a concern about outliving their [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Some are choosing to [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_retiring_abroad_for_canadians | retire abroad]] to make their money go further and enjoy a better lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Financial Challenge of Retiring in Canada

Living in Canada can be expensive, especially for retirees. The [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | average Canadian retiree]] receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS if starting at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This income often falls short of basic living expenses. For instance, in Toronto, a one-bedroom apartment averages about $2,100 per month. Adding utilities ($200), groceries ($400), and a transit pass ($150) quickly brings modest monthly expenses to over $3,000, excluding homeownership costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. CPP and OAS benefits barely cover a third of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Using Numbeo data, a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, and with rent, total monthly costs range from $3,500 to $4,000 for a modest lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This financial strain leads many Canadians to delay retirement or seek options abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Living in Toronto, he spends about $50,000 annually, relying on $18,000 from CPP and OAS, with the rest from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

- By age 70, Seth drains his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
- By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals, taking out over $46,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
- Effective tax rates creep above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
- By age 74, his savings are depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
- By age 76, his net worth turns negative, a nightmare scenario for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Seth's modest lifestyle in Toronto was unsustainable for his savings, highlighting how quickly a nest egg can unravel in a high-cost city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Top Retirement Destinations Abroad

Moving abroad can significantly alter a retiree's financial outlook, allowing their money to stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### 1. Mexico (Cancun Example)

Mexico is a popular choice for Canadians seeking warmth, affordability, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

-   **Lifestyle**: Offers year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild, spring-like weather in cities such as Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
-   **Healthcare**: Private clinics are modern, affordable, and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Private insurance is essential as public healthcare is not typically available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
-   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, generally requiring about $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
-   **Accessibility**: Convenient with direct flights from most major Canadian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
-   **Trade-offs**: Safety concerns vary by region, infrastructure can be inconsistent, bureaucracy requires patience, and some Spanish language skills are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

#### Seth's Retirement in Cancun

If Seth had moved to Cancun instead of Toronto, his financial outcome would be dramatically different. A single person renting a one-bedroom in Cancun spends about $1,700 CAD per month all-in, totaling around $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

-   With much lower living costs, his CPP and OAS cover most expenses, requiring only small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
-   His portfolio grows: $387,000 at age 70, $586,000 at age 80, and over $900,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
-   This illustrates the significant impact of location on [[effective_strategies_for_canadian_retirees_to_manage_retirement_savings | retirement savings]].

### 2. Portugal (Porto Example)

For those preferring a laid-back European lifestyle, Portugal offers old-world charm, a slower pace, good weather, and relatively affordable living for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

-   **Lifestyle**: Mild winters, sunny summers, with beach weather nearly year-round in the Algarve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Porto and Lisbon offer cooler, breezier climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
-   **Healthcare**: Excellent. Residents can access the public system, and private care is also affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
-   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, which requires a steady income (e.g., from CPP, pensions, investments) of about €870 per month (approx. $1,400 CAD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
-   **Accessibility**: Further than Mexico, but Lisbon and Porto offer direct flights to Toronto and Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
-   **Cost**: More expensive than Mexico, falling between Canada and Mexico in terms of cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

#### Seth's Retirement in Portugal (Porto)

In Porto, a more upscale choice than Cancun, monthly rent can be around $1,300, with other expenses adding $1,700, for a total of approximately $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This means Seth would spend about $36,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

-   With his $300,000 savings and $18,000 annual CPP/OAS, he draws from TFSA first, then RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
-   By age 75, his savings drop to $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
-   By age 80, he's down to just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
-   By age 84, his savings are empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

While Portugal offers a better runway than Toronto, it wasn't enough to sustain Seth's retirement to age 90, which is typically recommended for planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

#### Smart Adjustments for Seth in Portugal

By making smart [[effective_strategies_for_canadian_retirees_to_manage_retirement_savings | financial planning]] changes, Seth could improve his outlook:

-   Delaying CPP to age 70 and melting down his RRSP from 65-69 to cover the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This strategy lowers early taxes, maximizes CPP growth, and evens out withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
-   This one move alone extends his savings by two years, allowing him to run out at age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
-   Further options include working one more year, trimming spending, earning money from a hobby, or rethinking living location and travel frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### 3. Thailand

Thailand remains one of the best value retirement destinations, offering diverse environments from cool mountains (Chiang Mai) to beaches (Phuket, Hua Hin) and vibrant cities (Bangkok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

-   **Lifestyle**: Well-developed expat scene, rich culture, and incredible food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
-   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and highly regarded in Asia. Many doctors speak English, and private hospitals often exceed expectations for the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
-   **Visa**: To qualify for a retirement visa, you must be 50 or older and show 800,000 Thai Baht (approximately $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
-   **Cost of Living**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can cost $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. For Seth, with $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, this could be a perfect fit, covering most basic needs and allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 4. Paraguay

Paraguay is an emerging destination, primarily due to its tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

-   **Tax System**: Operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions is not taxed at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
-   **Cost of Living**: In Asunción, living expenses are about $628 per month, with a one-bedroom rent around $583, totaling just over $1,200 per month for a good lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
-   **Visa**: Offers a straightforward process to obtain a permanent residency visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
-   **Financial Sweet Spot**: For Seth, Paraguay represents a very low-cost, tax-efficient, and simple option for long-term settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### 5. Spain (Alicante Example)

Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

-   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents like Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
-   **Cost of Living**: In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,570, with a one-bedroom rent in the city center at about $1,300, bringing total monthly expenses to $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This is comparable to or slightly cheaper than some parts of Canada and Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
-   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, requiring about $40,000-$45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This is a higher bar but achievable with prior planning, such as earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP to boost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
-   **Benefits**: Offers a higher-end lifestyle, strong infrastructure, great weather, and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Canadians Retiring Abroad

### OAS Mistake: The 20-Year Rule

A critical mistake many Canadians make is not realizing they could lose their Old Age Security (OAS) payments when retiring abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

-   If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
-   However, if you are living outside Canada, you need **20 years** of Canadian residency after age 18 to keep receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
-   If you have between 10 and 20 years of residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

**Example: David's OAS Loss**
David, 67, with 15 years of Canadian residency, started collecting OAS in Calgary. When he retired to Thailand, his OAS stopped after 6 months because Thailand does not have a social security agreement with Canada, and he didn't meet the 20-year residency mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Understanding these [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | tax and residency rules for Canadians retiring abroad]] is crucial.

### General Advice for Retiring Abroad

-   **Research Costs**: Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs (rent, food, utilities) for your specific target country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
-   **Don't Rely Solely on Government Pensions**: Inflation, currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare costs can significantly impact your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
-   **Consider Challenges**: Life abroad isn't for everyone. Distance from family, adapting to new systems, and language barriers can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
-   **Plan Carefully**: A low-cost retirement can be amazing, but only if backed by a solid [[effective_strategies_for_canadian_retirees_to_manage_retirement_savings | financial plan]] that accounts for [[tax_considerations_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax rules]] and other big financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
