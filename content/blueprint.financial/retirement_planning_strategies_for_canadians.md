In 2024, approximately 106,000 Canadians permanently left the country, often to escape high costs, high taxes, and the fear of outliving their [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has led some Canadians to consider retiring abroad as a key [[financial_strategies_for_canadian_retirees | financial strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Challenge of Retiring in Canada

Living in Canada is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Cost of Living Example (Toronto, 2025)
>
> *   Rent for a one-bedroom: ~$2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
> *   Utilities: ~$200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
> *   Groceries: ~$400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
> *   Transit pass: ~$150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
>
> This totals over $3,000 a month for modest living without owning a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. CPP and OAS benefits barely cover a third of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Numbeo data suggests a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, bringing total monthly costs for modest living with rent to $3,500-$4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This highlights the [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | retirement income challenges in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Many Canadians are delaying retirement or seeking smarter options due to these high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Retiring Abroad: A Financial Strategy

Retiring abroad can be a viable strategy to make retirement savings stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This approach can allow for a decent lifestyle on lower monthly income, such as $1,300 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement Projections

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

#### Scenario 1: Retiring in Toronto
*   **Annual spending:** $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   **Income:** ~$18,000 annually from CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The rest from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   By age 70, TFSA is drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   By age 72, relies solely on RRSP withdrawals (over $46,000/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   Effective tax rates exceed 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   By age 74, runs out of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
    *   By age 76, net worth is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Analysis:** High costs in Toronto quickly deplete savings, even with modest living, illustrating a common [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | retirement income challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

#### Scenario 2: Retiring in Cancun, Mexico
*   **Cost of Living:** A single person renting a one-bedroom spends about $1,700 Canadian per month ($20,000 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Outcome (same savings, lower costs):**
    *   CPP and OAS cover most expenses, requiring small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   Portfolio grows: $387,000 at age 70, $586,000 at age 80, over $900,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Analysis:** Location significantly impacts financial longevity, allowing for wealth building instead of depletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

#### Scenario 3: Retiring in Porto, Portugal
*   **Cost of Living:** ~$1,300/month for rent + ~$1,700 for other expenses, totaling ~$3,000/month or $36,000/year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is comparable to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Outcome (same savings, moderate costs):**
    *   Initially manageable, but savings drop to ~$199,000 by age 75, just over $100,000 by age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   Runs out of money by age 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Analysis:** While better than Toronto, Portugal's costs were still too high for Seth's savings to last until age 90, which is a recommended planning age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Adjustments for a Longer Runway

Small adjustments can significantly impact a [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

*   **Delaying CPP:** If Seth delayed CPP until age 70 and started drawing down his RRSP from ages 65-69 to cover the gap, he could lower early taxes, maximize CPP growth, and even out withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This single move extends his savings by two years, running out at age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This is an example of [[retirement_strategies_integrating_cpp | retirement strategies integrating CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Other options:** Working an extra year, trimming spending, earning income from hobbies, or rethinking travel frequency can turn a challenging plan into a comfortable one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Popular Retirement Destinations Abroad

Here are some top picks for Canadian retirees seeking a more affordable lifestyle:

### Mexico
*   **Appeal:** Warm, affordable, close to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Offers year-round sunshine in areas like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild weather in Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Modern, affordable private clinics. Dental work can be significantly cheaper than in Canada (e.g., 20% of the price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Visa:** Temporary Resident Visa is suitable for retirees, requiring about $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Convenience:** Direct flights from most major Canadian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Considerations:** Safety varies by region, infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, bureaucracy requires patience, and private health insurance is essential for foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Portugal
*   **Appeal:** Laid-back European living with old-world charm, slower pace, great weather, and relatively affordable cost of living for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Mild winters and sunny summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

*   **Visa:** D7 passive income visa for those with steady income (CPP, pensions, investments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Requires about €870 per month ($1,400 CAD) to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

*   **Healthcare:** Modern, affordable, and widely regarded as some of the best in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Many doctors speak English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Visa:** Retirement visa requires being 50+ years old and showing 800,000 Thai Baht (~$33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living:** A full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can be $1,200-$1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. For someone with $1,500/month from CPP and OAS, this can cover basic needs and allow savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay
*   **Appeal:** Flying under the radar but gaining interest due to low costs and favorable taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Taxes:** Territorial tax system means foreign income (CPP, OAS, RIFs, pensions) is not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This offers significant [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | retirement tax strategies in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living:** In Asunción, living expenses are about $628 per month, with a one-bedroom rent around $583, totaling just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Visa:** Offers straightforward permanent residency visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

*   **Healthcare:** Excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living:** In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,570 with one-bedroom rent at $1,300, totaling $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is comparable to parts of Canada but potentially cheaper than Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Visa:** Non-lucrative visa requires about $40,000-$45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This might require strategic planning like earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP to boost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Retiring Abroad

### Old Age Security (OAS) Rules
*   **Crucial Rule:** If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Abroad Residency:** To continue receiving OAS long-term while living outside Canada, you need **20 years** of Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **The Trap:** If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency and move to a country without a social security agreement with Canada, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   **Example:** David had 15 years of Canadian residency, collected OAS in Calgary, then moved to Thailand (no social security agreement). His OAS stopped after 6 months because he didn't meet the 20-year mark for foreign residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Plan Carefully!
> Make sure to understand the OAS rules before moving abroad to avoid losing income you've earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### General Advice for [[Financial Planning for Retirement in Canada | Financial Planning for Retirement in Canada]] Abroad
*   **Research Costs:** Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs like rent, food, and utilities for your desired country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Don't Rely Solely on Government Benefits:** CPP and OAS alone may not be enough. Account for inflation, currency shifts, and unexpected healthcare costs, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Consider Personal Challenges:** Life abroad isn't for everyone. Be prepared for distance from family, new systems, and potential language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Solid Plan is Key:** A low-cost retirement can be amazing, but it requires a solid [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement plan]] that accounts for location, tax rules, and major financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Seek Expert Advice:** If serious about retiring abroad, consider professional advice to map out costs, taxes, and potential "what-ifs" to ensure you don't run out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
