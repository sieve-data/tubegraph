Effective communication is paramount for leaders and individuals seeking to advance their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. As Meta's CTO, Bos, famously stated, "communication is the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This article explores key strategies and frameworks for [[improving_communication_skills | improving communication skills]], drawing insights from expert Wes Ko, who emphasizes that communication is a skill that can be continuously refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Core Philosophy of Communication

Many operators are "shocked and horrified" when their poorly explained ideas lead to confusion, skepticism, or apathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead of blaming others, a key principle is self-reflection: "If I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This involves asking:
*   "How could I explain this more clearly?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   "How can I be more compelling?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   "How can I anticipate any questions that they might have?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

This perspective promotes agency, focusing on what can be controlled – one's own communication behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Effective communication is a means to an end, with the ultimate goal being to achieve the ideal outcome, such as buy-in, good team decisions, or moving to the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### Practice Like It's Game Day
It is common to see operators save their "best behavior" for executives, but this limits the opportunities to practice [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking | effective leadership and strategic thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. To truly improve executive communication, one must treat every stakeholder as important and use every interaction as a chance to practice, not just high-stakes presentations to senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Forms of Communication
[[strategies_for_effective_communication_and_alignment_in_growing_organizations | Leadership and company culture]] involves both verbal and written communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Verbal:** Meetings, conversations, presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
*   **Written:** Emails, strategy documents, Notion docs, Slack messages, text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>

## Key Communication Frameworks and Tactics

### Sales Then Logistics
A common mistake is overestimating audience buy-in, leading to jumping straight into the "how" or logistics of a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. A "sales note" is designed to generate excitement and agreement to *do* something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Only *after* buy-in should logistics be shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Example:** An operations head struggled to get executive team members to submit weekly wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. She led with the document, deadline, and format (logistics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Instead, she should have started by "selling" them on *why* this matters: it shines a light on their team, motivates employees, and helps the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **Concise Selling:** Even for busy executives, a brief 1-2 minute (or even a couple of sentences) framing of *why* the topic matters and *what is needed* from them can prevent misunderstandings and delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Conciseness
Conciseness is not about absolute word count but about "economy of words" and the "density of the insight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. A 1000-word memo can be more concise than a 300-word meandering one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The bottleneck to conciseness is often a lack of clarity in one's own thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   **Preparation is Key:** The most consistent solution for conciseness is preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Even a few minutes before a meeting or drafting a message can make a huge difference, allowing you to focus and prioritize key points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **Reviewing Your Work:** Always review what you've written at least once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. This helps trim unnecessary words and tidy sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **The "Blast Radius" of Poor Writing:** A poorly written memo or Slack message can create significant back-and-forth and confusion for many people, wasting collective time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. Taking a few extra moments upfront can help numerous recipients be "off to the races" immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

### Signposting
Signposting involves using specific words, phrases, formatting, and structure to guide the reader or listener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This helps add structure and signals what is coming next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Examples:** "For example," "because," "as a next step," "first, second, third," "the most important part to pay attention to is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
*   These words are "power words for clarity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>, helping to grab attention and provide structure.

### Formatting Best Practices
Excessive formatting (e.g., 30% of a note bolded) negates its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. Use formatting sparingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **Complete Sentences over Fragments:** Avoid overusing bullets with sentence fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. Use complete sentences to show the connective tissue and logical flow of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. Turning fragments into full sentences can reveal if an idea was fully thought out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. This aligns with the [[leadership_and_management_development | Amazon six-page memo]] philosophy, where writing out prose clarifies thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

## Measuring and Practicing Communication Skills

### Measuring Effectiveness
The effectiveness of communication can be measured by how quickly and enthusiastically you get the desired reaction from your recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. The goal is to reduce friction and back-and-forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

### Practicing for Improvement
*   **Start Small:** Don't try to incorporate 30 different tactics at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. Pick one area, focus on it, practice in various settings, and master it before moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
*   **Hypothesis-Driven Mindset:** Treat communication as an experiment: "When I do this, how does that other person react? If I frame it this way, do I get a different reaction?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.
*   **Compounding Effect:** Small improvements in daily communication compound over time to create significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. Claiming "diminishing returns" too early often overlooks the potential for creativity and better execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. Investing a little more time upfront saves much more time later by preventing confusion and rework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

### Finding the Right Level of Confidence
Speak accurately about your level of conviction and the evidence you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overconfidence:** Do not state hypotheses as facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Distinguish between "this is X" and "this could X" or "this might X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. It's okay to present an "initial hunch," but be clear that it's not a proven fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. Overstating confidence can lead to misallocated resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   **Avoid Underconfidence:** Do not diminish strong recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. If you have solid reasoning, it's "irresponsible" to act unsure, as it can lead to missed opportunities for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.
*   **Present a POV with Evidence:** Share a point of view or recommendation, backing it up with evidence, logic, first principles, examples, or data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. This allows others to push back, poke holes, or align with specificity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. Be accurate in presenting facts, and clarify when something is a hunch or theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Avoid biasing data to fit an agenda, as this erodes trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.

### Avoiding the "Single-Minded Martyr" Pitfall
A "single-minded martyr" has an agenda and presents only evidence supporting their recommendation, becoming frustrated when others are skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.
*   **Context is Crucial:** Understand the broader organizational context and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>. A proposal, while good, might not align with current company-wide goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. More senior individuals understand that the best decision for the company might not be immediate prioritization or require a right-sized investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>. Prioritizing "what's best for the company" over personal wins helps gain buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.

### MOO (Most Obvious Objection)
The MOO framework stands for "Most Obvious Objection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. This involves anticipating questions and counterarguments *before* you present your ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.
*   Even two minutes of thought can reveal obvious objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
*   Knowing your own argument, including counterarguments, helps you prepare and avoid being caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.
*   This proactive thinking (e.g., "If I'm about to say this, the person may then say this to me") allows you to volunteer information upfront or frame your message to preempt issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   Thinking about MOO also helps clarify your own thinking; you might realize a gap in your plan and strengthen your pitch before presenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.

### Staying Calm in High-Stakes Conversations
When faced with questions you don't immediately know the answer to, avoid making things up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.
*   **Beyond "I'll Get Back to You":** Instead of a default "I'll get back to you," try to answer a similar question or probe for more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.
    *   *Example:* If asked "what percentage of users came from mobile last month?" and you don't know, you could say, "I don't have that number off the top of my head, but in the last quarter, the number has been 60 to 70%, and it's grown in the past year. Are you wondering if we are investing in mobile appropriately?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
*   **The "Question Behind the Question":** Often, there's a deeper underlying concern behind a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. Your responsibility is to figure out what that might be by probing and validating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.
*   **Reflecting Back:** If unsure, reflect the question back to the person to gain time to think and clarify what they're looking for ("Let me just make sure I understand what you're thinking, what you're looking for...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.

## Communication in Management

### Managing Up
Managing up is a crucial skill that becomes *more* important as one becomes more senior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. As you climb the ladder, tasks become less defined, and you deal with more ambiguity and broad mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Managing up involves ensuring your manager is informed and aligned with your actions and plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.
*   **Share Your Point of View:** The most highly leveraged way to manage up is to be vocal about sharing your point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. Instead of asking "What should we do?", offer "Here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.
*   This reduces your manager's cognitive load and demonstrates that you are an active, rigorous, strategic thinker who is proactively solving problems and forming hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
*   Even junior employees can do this; they often have the most proximity and visibility into specific problems or customer issues, and managers value these insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

### Giving Effective Feedback: "Strategy Not Self-Expression"
When giving feedback, the goal is *behavior change*, not simply expressing frustration or venting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.
*   **Trim the Unnecessary:** Focus on only the part of the feedback that will motivate the person to change, helping them understand the benefit to themselves and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. This often means trimming 90% of what you initially want to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>.
*   **Vent Separately:** Before the conversation, vent frustrations to a therapist, partner, or friend to release emotional energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>. This allows you to enter the feedback conversation feeling clear, grounded, and focused on a positive emotional tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

### Delegating with High Standards: The CEDAF Framework
To delegate effectively while maintaining high standards, use the CEDAF framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>:
*   **C - Comprehension:** Provide everything needed for the person to understand the task, including logins, context, and what the end result should look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **E - Excitement:** Explain the "why" behind the task to make it exciting and connect it to broader project goals, career goals, or company priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.
*   **D - Derisk:** Anticipate and address obvious risks. For example, if there's a risk of the person going in the wrong direction for too long, suggest checking in after a smaller portion of the work is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.
*   **A - Align:** Give the other person a chance to speak up, ask questions, and confirm understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. This often reveals forgotten details or areas of confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.
*   **F - Feedback:** Establish the shortest possible feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>. Instead of a weekly check-in, aim for daily, or even brainstorm initial steps within the same delegation conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. This proactive approach saves time and ensures alignment.

## Auxiliary Tools for Communication Mastery

### The Swipe File
A "swipe file" is a collection of inspiration that can be referred back to later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. For communication, this can be a file of well-articulated phrases, words, or strategic expressions that you find intelligent or effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>.
*   The act of adding to the swipe file trains you to be more alert to noticing what works well and thinking about *why* it was effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.
*   It can include anything from compelling copy and landing pages to effective strategy documents or design screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>.

### Leveraging AI for Communication
AI tools like Claude can be valuable thought partners for improving communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.
*   **Drafting Support:** Use AI for initial drafts or to help formulate responses to difficult emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.
*   **Providing Context:** Share your specific problem and desired outcome with the AI to get better output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. For example, explain why you need to decline an offer but want to be respectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** After receiving a draft, edit it to your voice (e.g., less formal) and then ask the AI for further improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. AI's tendency to "shorten the feedback loop and align" by breaking tasks into smaller chunks parallels effective human delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Career Shifts

### Life Mottos
*   **"Everything takes longer than you think."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a> – Apply buffers to all plans, from daily errands to career building and product launches, to reduce stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.
*   **"Always be selling."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a> – This means consistently putting effort into convincing others of your recommendations, not just hawking wares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.

### Lessons from Solo Operating
Transitioning from an in-house operator to a solo operator offers significant freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. As a solo operator, you can "craft your work around only your strengths" and the parts you are best at and love doing most, especially where there is market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. This involves being discerning about opportunities, choosing settings where you can truly shine, and focusing on your core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:54">[01:30:54]</a>. This focus on maximizing personal strengths and value aligns with concepts in [[leadership_and_company_culture | leadership and company culture]].
