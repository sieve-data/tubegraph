[[career_development_and_advice | Career development and advice]] for product managers, from early stages to senior leadership, emphasizes long-term vision, continuous learning, and adapting to industry changes.

## The Danger of Short-Term Thinking

Many individuals focus on immediate career desires, such as disliking a boss or feeling a company is too slow [00:07:43]. These short-term concerns, though potentially true, often lead to lateral moves rather than forward progression [00:07:55]. A more effective approach is to consider your career as a product, working backward from an ideal "end state" and planning "versions" of your [[career development and progression strategies | career progression]] [00:08:11]. This involves thinking not just about the next job, but the one after it, or even your boss's boss's job, to strategically navigate your path [00:08:30]. This long-term perspective can help you decide whether to "grit it out" in a current role to gain valuable experience or move on [00:08:56].

Another common short-term focus is equating [[career development and progression strategies | career development and progression strategies]] solely with promotion [00:09:18]. While promotion is a system for moving forward within a company, it is distinct from overall career growth, which encompasses a longer arc [00:09:47].

## Building a Diverse Career Portfolio

Collecting "logos" or working for well-known companies can provide value, especially for executives who need to demonstrate expertise in scaling organizations [00:10:46]. However, simply chasing fancy brands can feel shallow for product people who fundamentally enjoy building [00:11:20]. A diverse set of experiences is highly beneficial, including working with:
*   Pre-product market fit companies [00:12:02]
*   Companies transitioning from "smoke to fire" [00:12:05]
*   Established companies turning "fire into something great" [00:12:10]

Experiencing different stages of growth, along with consumer and business-to-business problems, makes one a better "builder" and typically leads to greater satisfaction [00:12:15]. Focusing solely on "logos" without a build-oriented purpose can lead to [[understanding_personal_and_career_fulfillment | sadness and lack of fulfillment]] [00:12:46].

### The "Ex-Growth Company" Trap

Beware of "ex-growth companies" – organizations that raised substantial capital during periods of hyper-growth but have since lost their growth trajectory [00:16:19]. These companies may not be laying off staff or actively raising new rounds, but they are often still searching for product-market fit with inflated valuations [00:16:30].

**Signs of an "Ex-Growth Company":**
*   The company is still trying to find product-market fit but has a valuation in the hundreds of millions or more [00:18:30].
*   Significant effort is required to acquire users, indicating a lack of inherent "pull" from the product [00:20:58].

For employees, staying in such a company can mean that equity compensation may become worthless, leading to a significant pay cut compared to market rates [00:20:00]. While founders have options like recapitalization or restarting, employees generally have "no recourse" and should consider leaving to avoid losing investment in a "new four-year investment" [00:19:16]. The primary reasons to consider staying are if it's the biggest role you could get and offers unique learning opportunities, or due to loyalty to the team [00:21:34].

## Early Career Product Managers

For [[career development for product owners and product managers | early career product managers]], two key pieces of [[career development and advice | advice]] stand out:

1.  **Build World-Class Expertise:** Identify and become proficient in one of the core product ambiguities as early as possible. This could be expertise in:
    *   Crafting [00:23:14]
    *   Market ambiguity [00:23:18]
    *   Organizational ambiguity [00:23:27]
    *   Domain expertise (e.g., ML, hardware) [00:23:35]
    *   Team expertise (e.g., managing managers) [00:23:47]
    *   Growth [00:24:15]
    Picking a specific "lane" is crucial [00:24:21].

2.  **Develop a Compelling Career Story:** Be able to articulate what you learned and achieved in each role, using "I" statements rather than "we" statements [00:24:30]. Think about the story you will tell your next employer, as if writing a press release for your career, and ensure it is compelling [00:25:01].

## Navigating Promotions in Mid-Career

Understanding why promotions may not be happening requires looking beyond surface-level complaints:

1.  **Lack of Advocacy:** You may have "magic," but your manager or promotion committee doesn't see or advocate for it. In this case, consider a project shift, finding a new manager, or leaving the company [00:26:26].
2.  **Non-Existent Next Role:** In slower growth environments, the next level of role might simply not exist due to limited hiring or restructuring [00:27:05].
3.  **Impatience:** High performers, accustomed to rapid advancement, may become frustrated when leadership roles require longer absorption periods and softer skills, which develop more slowly [00:28:02].
4.  **Unacknowledged Development Areas:** Approximately 50% of the time, there's a legitimate development area that the individual may not recognize, or refuses to change [00:28:57]. Managers may be poor at identifying it, or the individual might be unwilling to hear it [00:29:10]. This requires self-awareness and a willingness to change [00:29:41].

### The Importance of Genuine Feedback

To understand if you have an unacknowledged development area, seek "real feedback" rather than formal feedback [00:30:41]. This means creating an environment of safety where people feel comfortable sharing honest insights without fear of retaliation [00:31:53]. When receiving feedback, practice repeating it back to the giver, even if it's difficult to hear, to show you're listening and internalizing it [00:32:21]. Managers can encourage feedback by publicly acknowledging and thanking individuals who provide it in staff meetings [00:34:11].

## The Managerial Path

The tech industry has historically lacked sufficient training for managers, often promoting individuals based on technical prowess rather than managerial skills [00:35:28]. This creates an "epidemic" of challenges, including issues with bias, coaching, and addressing development areas [00:36:19].

For [[career growth strategies for product managers | new managers]], key considerations include:
*   **Sharing the Steering Wheel:** Management isn't about dividing tasks or teaching someone to ride a bike and letting go. It's more like a sidecar on a motorcycle, where the manager provides counsel from a supporting role [00:37:19].
*   **Earning the Right to Manage:** Managers have organizational power but must "earn the right" to be invited into their team members' professional space, like a "vampire knocking on the door" [00:38:21]. Offer help and partner on specific areas when invited [00:38:57].

### The Rise of the Senior Individual Contributor (IC) Path

The increasing focus on Individual Contributor (IC) tracks, especially in larger companies like Meta, is seen as a positive development for the industry [00:40:46]. Historically, many talented individuals were pushed into management without proper training, resulting in average managers and diluted "builder" roles [00:41:00]. The IC track allows product professionals to deepen their expertise in areas like market, organizational, or domain ambiguity, becoming world-class builders [00:41:51]. This contrasts with managers who might spend more time on documentation, resource justification, and headcount [00:44:00]. The IC path, which is well-established in engineering and design, allows product managers to remain focused on "building stuff" and is expected to become a stronger, more solid career path over time [00:43:00].

### The Power of Community in Learning

Given the lack of formal manager training, communities (both internal and external) are becoming crucial for [[career growth and personal development | learning and growth]] [00:46:16]. Communities offer:
*   Safety and authenticity [00:46:27]
*   A sense of not being alone [00:46:33]
*   Shared best practices [00:46:36]

Nikhail Singhal, a seasoned product leader, created "The Skip CPO Community" to address the loneliness of senior leadership roles. This community of Chief Product Officers (CPOs) offers a safe space for authentic conversations, sharing challenges, and finding solutions [00:48:44]. The community is focused on product leaders in mid to late-stage companies, as their problems tend to be most similar [00:51:00]. For those looking for communities, Nikhail suggests searching for "The Skip CPO community" on LinkedIn and connecting with members, or finding other relevant communities online [00:50:42].

## Later Career and Avoiding the "Rabbit Trap"

Many senior leaders face unexpected mental health challenges or a sense of being lost after achieving their initial career goals [01:02:23]. This phenomenon is likened to dog racing: if a dog accidentally catches the "fake rabbit" it's chasing, it may never run again because its goal has been achieved, leaving it without a next objective [01:05:02].

In a world where careers can span 60-70 years, achieving a major milestone like becoming a VP or starting a company at age 30 can leave a significant portion of one's career without a guiding "North Star" [01:05:50]. This can lead to dissatisfaction, creating unnecessary conflict, or unhealthy habits [01:06:20].

### The "Shadows of Superpowers"

Senior leaders often struggle with hidden development areas that are direct consequences of their core strengths [00:53:11]. This concept, known as "shadows of superpowers," explains why what "got you here isn't what got you there" [00:53:55]. For example:
*   A great collaborator might struggle as a leader if their collaboration relies on others agreeing with their views [00:54:44].
*   Individuals excellent at growth might struggle with innovation [00:55:34].
*   World-class storytellers might struggle with details [00:55:38].
*   Amazing listeners might be indecisive [00:56:06].

These shadow areas are hard to recognize because they are tied to one's identity and past successes [00:56:35]. The key to breaking through this is to listen to "contradictory feedback" – feedback that challenges what you perceive as your strengths – and avoid dismissing it as an anomaly [00:57:30]. This self-reflection, often sparked by direct, trusted feedback, is crucial for continued [[career growth and personal development | growth and avoiding plateauing]] [00:59:01].

### Finding a "Second North Star" (Act 3)

[[understanding_personal_and_career_fulfillment | Understanding personal and career fulfillment]] in the later stages of a long career (Act 3) is critical for [[creating_space_and_opportunities_for_new_career_paths | creating space and opportunities for new career paths]]. There are two main arcs for this phase:
1.  **Scaled Economics:** Continuing to focus on wealth accumulation, potentially through investing or private equity [01:09:09].
2.  **Giving:** Shifting focus to contribute to others. This can take many forms, such as content creation, volunteering, or starting mission-based companies [01:09:41].

While early career stages might be focused on "taking and creating," the later stages offer an opportunity to predicate oneself around "giving to others" for greater fulfillment and societal benefit [01:10:06]. This shift requires intentional planning and reinvention to establish a new "North Star" that provides ongoing motivation and meaning beyond initial career achievements [01:07:30].

## Key Takeaways for Career Development

*   **Plan Long-Term:** Think beyond the next job; consider the "skip" job and your career's ultimate trajectory [00:08:11].
*   **Differentiate Career from Promotion:** Understand that company promotions are just one aspect of broader [[career development and progression strategies | career growth and development]] [00:09:28].
*   **Build Specialized Skills:** Early in your [[career development for product owners and product managers | product management career]], become world-class in a specific area of product ambiguity [00:24:04].
*   **Craft Your Story:** Actively build a compelling personal narrative of your achievements and learnings for future opportunities [01:21:38].
*   **Seek and Accept Feedback:** Actively solicit and internalize contradictory feedback, especially concerning your perceived strengths [00:57:30].
*   **Leverage Community:** Join and actively participate in communities for authentic learning, support, and shared best practices [00:46:16].
*   **Define Your Act 3:** Begin considering your "second North Star" or purpose for the later stages of your career to maintain motivation and fulfillment [01:06:05].
