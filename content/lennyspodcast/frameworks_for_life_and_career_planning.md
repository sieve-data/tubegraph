Graham Weaver, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business and founder/CEO of Alpine Investors, observes that the most common question students ask him for [[career_advice_and_frameworks | advice]] is "What should I do with my life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> He emphasizes that many people operate in "autopilot mode," unconsciously going through daily routines without intentional direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. His courses and frameworks aim to help individuals break free from this state and pursue a [[building_a_long_and_meaningful_career | long and meaningful career]] that aligns with their true desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

## Getting Out of Autopilot Mode

Being in autopilot mode means living unconsciously, often without realizing *why* you're doing what you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. A typical day might involve waking up, working out, commuting, attending meetings, answering emails, and fighting traffic, without considering if these actions align with personal values or long-term aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The majority of our thoughts (95-98%) are subconscious, programmed by media, friends, parents, and societal pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. To break free, one must create space for intentionality, ask deep questions, and ensure their calendar reflects their desired life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## The Genie Framework

This framework encourages individuals to identify their deepest aspirations by imagining a magic genie granting one wish: whatever they fully commit to will turn out great, leading to happiness and success beyond imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The core question is: "What would you wish for if you knew it would turn out great and you'd be happy you did it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> This question helps uncover desires absent the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

The goal is to align one's life with this "genie goal," even if it means taking initial steps that are challenging or not immediately lucrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Examples of genie goals include:
*   Starting a non-profit to provide education access in one's home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Founding a private equity firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   Building an amusement park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   Starting a tech startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Reflective Questions for [[the_importance_of_asking_reflective_questions_in_career | Self-Discovery]]

Beyond the Genie Framework, other questions can help identify one's true path:
*   What would you do if you didn't have to make money? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>
*   What's play for you that is work for other people? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>
*   What's the thing you really want to do but are too embarrassed to say? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>
*   Who are some people you admire and want to be more like? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>
*   What do you want to learn and how do you want to grow over the next 5-10 years? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>

## Addressing Limiting Beliefs

Limiting beliefs are most dangerous when they remain subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. These can manifest as fears (e.g., "I don't know how to start a charity," "I have debt," "I don't have a plan") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

To overcome them:
1.  **Write them down:** Putting beliefs on paper strips them of much of their power and scariness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
2.  **Translate to-do items:** What seems like a scary fear becomes a concrete obstacle to be overcome, like any other problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

## The Nine Lives Exercise

This exercise helps explore different potential career and life paths in a less intimidating way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.
*   **Rule 1:** All "lives" must start from today; no going back in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
*   **Rule 2:** You must be excited about all these lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.

List nine distinct lives you could lead (e.g., current job, founder, author, professor, actor, social media creator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

The benefits of this exercise include:
*   **Identifying energy sources:** Recognize which "life" gives you the most energy and try to integrate aspects of it into your current life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. This can provide tremendous energy even if it starts as a side pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
*   **Realizing multiple paths:** You can often experience many of these "nine lives" over the course of a lifetime, just not all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. Careers often pivot multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

This framework also combats the "not now" trap, where people delay pursuing their true desires indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. It's important to realize it's never truly the "right time" for significant change, and embracing uncertainty is part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.

## The Importance of Long-Term Commitment and "Worse First"

Graham Weaver emphasizes that true success, particularly in ventures like his private equity firm, Alpine Investors, often takes a decade or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. Many founders and entrepreneurs fail because they don't commit for long enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. Social media often portrays overnight success, which is rarely the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

He lives by the quote:
> "Life is suffering, so choose something worth suffering for." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>

Suffering is inherent in any path, so it's better to endure it for something you care deeply about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

Another core principle is:
> "Everything you want is on the other side of worse first." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>

Whether it's getting in shape, changing careers, or ending a bad relationship, the initial step is often negative, difficult, and uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. Optimizing for immediate comfort leads to stagnation, whereas making decisions based on where you want to be five years from now allows for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

### When to Quit

While persistence is key, there are times to quit. Graham advises quitting when you can no longer see or believe in the vision for a prolonged period, or when you are no longer genuinely excited about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. However, it's crucial to distinguish between a temporary lack of excitement during "dark days" and a fundamental loss of belief in the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. Success often comes from identifying and "scaling your bright spots"—finding what is working and doing more of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.

## Accountability for [[building_strategy_skills_and_effective_goals | Achieving Goals]]

To ensure progress towards [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | career development and growth]], accountability is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>:

*   **Executive Coaches:** Like a personal trainer for your life, a coach creates space to ask big questions about career, relationships, health, and spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. They help define intentions and hold you accountable for actions, often through structured check-ins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.
*   **Accountability Partner:** If a coach isn't feasible, find a like-minded friend to meet regularly and discuss your goals and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. Talking about goals activates more of your brain than just thinking or writing about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.
*   **The "Green Notebook" Exercise:** Write down your long-term goal (e.g., "I am the number one rower in the country") at the top of a page every morning, and then list three specific actions you will take *that day* to move toward that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. This powerfully programs your subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

## Internal vs. External Journey

The true game of life is an internal one, not an external one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. While external factors like food and shelter are necessary, much of life is shaped by internal narratives and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. People often write stories for themselves about what they need to be happy, worthy, or respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.

Realizing that these narratives are "just a story" can be terrifying but ultimately liberating, as it grants agency over defining what truly matters on one's own internal scorecard, independent of external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. Graham experienced this realization after achieving significant external success with his firm, only to find that his internal state remained unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

A powerful starting point for this internal journey is the affirmation: "I am enough." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>

Ultimately, Weaver encourages individuals to take the time to define what a "wonderful, amazing, incredible life" looks like across all domains (career, relationships, health, spirituality, finances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. Clarity on this vision is the first step toward making it a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

> "Don't ask what the world needs. Ask instead what makes you come alive, because what the world needs most is for you to come alive." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>
