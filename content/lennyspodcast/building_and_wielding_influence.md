Influence, often referred to as "power," is a crucial skill that leads to numerous positive outcomes, including promotions, career happiness, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This concept isn't about personality; it's about skills that can be mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, teaches an oversubscribed course called "The Paths to Power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. His recent book, *The Seven Rules of Power*, summarizes his teachings on how to [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | build your power]] to achieve goals and [[building_a_long_and_meaningful_career | advance in your career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The class is described as "cod liver oil" – good for you, but it makes you nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Why Power Makes People Uncomfortable

The discomfort many people feel around the topic of power stems from a disconnect between how the world *is* and how they *want* it to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The realities of acquiring power often don't align with traditional upbringing or aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. People also see power being used for negative purposes and confuse the tool itself with its misuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

> [!INFO] Power as a Tool
> A hammer can be used to hit people, or to build something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. A knife can be used by a surgeon to cure cancer or by a mugger to rob people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Power, like these tools, is neither good nor bad; its impact depends on its wielder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. For power to be used for good, more good people need to possess it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Individuals from underrepresented backgrounds often need to learn power skills even more, as the world may be stacked against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## The Seven Rules of Power

Jeffrey Pfeffer outlines [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | Seven Rules of Power]] that can be applied to [[building_a_long_and_meaningful_career | advance in your career]] and get things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>:

7.  Success Excuses Almost Everything (Once you've [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | acquired power]], what you did to get there will be forgiven/forgotten) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

### 1. [[overcoming_discomfort_in_acquiring_power | Get Out Of Your Own Way]]

The primary barrier to acquiring power is self-sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. If you believe power is "dirty" or "evil," you won't take the necessary steps to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

Another common self-imposed obstacle is Impostor Syndrome, where individuals feel undeserving of their positions despite their qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. This can manifest as preemptory apologies ("I don't know if this comment will be useful") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Stop apologizing for your presence or contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "If you want to be liked, get a dog." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>

While you shouldn't intentionally seek to be disliked, prioritizing being liked over competence and respect will cap your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. Your role requires performance; if you are hired to do a job, use your skills to make the organization successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

### 2. [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | Break The Rules]]

Breaking rules helps you stand out and become memorable, which is crucial for visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. Rules are often created by those who benefit from the existing system, so disrupting them can create new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Don't Ask, Don't Get
> A common conventional wisdom is "don't ask for help, show self-sufficiency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. However, research shows that asking for help is often effective and makes people uncomfortable but isn't as bad as people think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. The worst that can happen is a "no," leaving you no worse off than if you hadn't asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

Jason Calacanis is cited as someone who consistently breaks rules in the venture capital industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. He makes many small bets, runs a lean operation, and doesn't have partners, making him difficult to fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. His background in journalism also provided him with unique insights, helping him stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

### 3. Show Up in a Powerful Fashion

How you present yourself significantly impacts how others perceive you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. Research suggests people respond most to visual appearance, then to vocal tone, and least to the actual content of what is said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>.

Key aspects of appearing powerful include:
*   **Body Language:** Confident posture (e.g., open body posture), ample gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.
*   **Vocal Presence:** Louder voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.
*   **Eye Contact:** Do not read from notes; maintain strong eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. This projects control and mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.
*   **Brevity:** Keep communication concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
*   **Emotional Expression:** Anger, being outside the norm, can signal power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. Disinhibited laughter can also be a sign of comfort and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.
*   **Physical Presence:** Invading personal space (gentle touching, standing close) can signify power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. Tall and attractive people often earn more, as people subconsciously respond to appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

These are all skills that can be learned and mastered through practice and coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. Regis McKenna, a public relations expert, famously helped Steve Jobs develop his presentation skills, transforming him into someone who could sell anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

### 4. [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | Build a Powerful Brand]]

To [[building_a_long_and_meaningful_career | advance in your career]], you must be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. It's not enough to be smart; people need to know who you are and what you're capable of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Building a brand means differentiating yourself and creating value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

Examples of brand building:
*   Keith Ferrazzi, at Deloitte Consulting, started the Lincoln Quality Award instead of traditional spreadsheet work, increasing Deloitte's brand recognition and leading to his appointment as the first Chief Marketing Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   Tristan Walker, seeking a job at Foursquare, started signing up partnerships on his own, which eventually led the founder to hire him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   Laura Chau, a venture capitalist, built her brand through writing, starting a podcast featuring influential people, contributing to books, and hosting networking dinners to become known in the consumer tech space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. She even strategically emphasized her height and unique style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Visibility vs. Substance
> Visibility without substance is useless, but substance without visibility will go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

Reframing self-promotion as "amplifying the impact of the team" or "scaling yourself by sharing knowledge" can make it feel less uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

### 5. [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | Network Relentlessly]]

Networking is often perceived as "dirty," but its core principle is generosity: "What can I do for you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. The more people you know, the more helpful you can be, and the more knowledge you gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

> [!INFO] Become a Broker
> To maximize your network's impact, strive to become a "broker" – someone who connects people and groups that would benefit from being connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. Venture capitalists, investment bankers, and real estate agents are examples of professionals whose jobs revolve around connecting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.

**The Strength of Weak Ties:**
People you are strongly tied to (family, close friends, immediate colleagues) likely know the same things and people you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. Building ties with "weak ties" – people who are more different from you – increases your likelihood of learning non-redundant information and connecting with new individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. Research shows that jobs obtained through weak ties are often better than those found through formal means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.

### 6. [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | Use Your Power]]

Using your power builds more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. When you are put in a position of authority to make things happen, and you successfully mobilize resources to achieve goals, you will gain more resources and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Success attracts more people who want to work with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>. This creates a self-perpetuating growth cycle of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Self-Fulfilling Prophecy of Power
> Life is not homeostatic; it is self-fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. If others believe you are powerful, you will likely become more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

### 7. Success Excuses Almost Everything

Once you have [[the_psychology_of_power_and_selfpromotion | acquired power]], past actions that might have been controversial or questionable are often forgiven or forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. People are attracted to money, power, and success, and they are willing to overlook flaws to be associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. This rule highlights how the world operates, not how it should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Lindsey Graham's shift from criticizing Donald Trump to becoming a strong supporter to remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.
*   People forgetting the origins of Microsoft's code or Jeffrey Epstein's criminal past in the context of his continued social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.
*   Martha Stewart rebuilding a valuable brand after serving jail time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

## Overcoming the "Knowing-Doing Gap"

The "Knowing-Doing Gap" refers to the disconnect between understanding what to do and actually doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. To apply these power principles, you must move beyond theoretical knowledge to practical application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>.

> [!INFO] Stages of Learning Power Skills
> When learning power skills, individuals typically go through four stages:
> 1.  **Denial:** "It doesn't work in my culture/organization/for me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>
> 2.  **Anger:** "How can you teach us this stuff?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>
> 3.  **Sadness/Depression:** "I actually believe this, and I'm depressed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:04">[01:52:04]</a>
> 4.  **Acceptance:** Embracing the reality and applying the skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>.

To facilitate acceptance and real change:
*   **Start Small:** Don't attempt drastic changes immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>. Begin where you can and gradually push yourself out of your comfort zone, like swimming in pools before tackling the English Channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:04">[01:54:04]</a>. This aligns with the "15% rule" of pushing slightly beyond your comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:58">[01:54:58]</a>.
*   **Practice and Coaching:** Just like learning a sport or a musical instrument, power skills require consistent practice and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.
*   **Social Support:** Get a coach or a personal board of directors to provide advice, social support, and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:53">[01:57:53]</a>. It's difficult to make progress on your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>.

## The Price of Power

While power offers significant advantages, it also comes with downsides:
*   **Loss of Autonomy:** Powerful positions often mean losing control over your time and schedule, as others dictate your engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.
*   **Enormous Visibility and Scrutiny:** Increased power brings increased public and private scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>. Every aspect of your life may be dissected, leading to a loss of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.
*   **Trust Dilemma:** When rich and powerful, it becomes difficult to discern if people associate with you because of who you are or because of your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.
*   **Impact on Family:** The pursuit and maintenance of power can take a significant toll on your family, leading to issues like divorce and strained relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "You can have power or you can have autonomy, but you cannot have both." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>

Understanding these trade-offs is essential for making informed decisions about [[building_a_long_and_meaningful_career | career advancement]] and life priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>.
