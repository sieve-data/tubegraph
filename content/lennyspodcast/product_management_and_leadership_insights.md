Naomi Gleit, Head of Product at Meta, is the longest-serving executive at Meta besides Mark Zuckerberg, having joined Facebook as employee number 29 almost 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. She has witnessed the company's growth from 30 employees to a $1.5 trillion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Naomi is passionate about the [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] function and views product managers as a significant point of leverage for a company to achieve its goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Journey to Meta and Product Management

Naomi's journey to Meta began during her time at Stanford, where her senior thesis focused on why Facebook would succeed against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Driven by her belief in the product, she repeatedly "cold-called" the Facebook office (then located above Jing Jing's Chinese restaurant in Palo Alto), visiting five to ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

After initially not getting a personal assistant role for Sean Parker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, she later received a marketing job offer, opting for Facebook over a competing offer from LinkedIn due to her excitement for social networking and observed [[Product management skills and best practices | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. She embraced the advice to "get a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

Her passion for building led her to pursue [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]]. Without a technical background, she sought to work with engineers and volunteered for projects, gradually taking on program management and providing product feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. By the time she formally applied for a PM role, she had already been doing the job informally for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Her transition was met with a standing ovation from her future PM and engineering colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Leadership and Management Philosophy

Naomi Gleit’s approach to [[Product Leadership and Management Techniques | product leadership]] and management is guided by several core principles and "Naomi-isms."

### The PM as a Conductor
Naomi likens the [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | Product Manager]] to a conductor of an orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>. In this metaphor:
*   The team is the orchestra, with different functions (legal, policy, comms, data analytics, engineering, design) as different instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
*   The PM ensures each part is played correctly, and all sections play together in harmony, at the right tempo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.
*   The PM is not the star of the show; conductors do not even speak during a performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.
*   Good teams, like orchestras, are in harmony, in sync, and have the right cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

### Extreme Clarity
Naomi emphasizes the importance of "extreme clarity" to ensure everyone is on the same page, even if they disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. This avoids misunderstandings and allows focus on substantive disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

Tactics for achieving extreme clarity:
*   **Canonical Nomenclature:** Establishing a shared vocabulary by defining terms to prevent people from using different words to describe the same things, or the same words for different things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. For example, distinguishing between "consistency" (agreement among reviewers) and "accuracy" (correctness according to ground truth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
*   **Visuals in Meetings:** Using visual aids (like slides) and real-time editing them to reflect decisions and next steps, ensuring collective agreement before leaving the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.
*   **Numbered Lists:** Using numbered lists instead of bullet points for easier reference and clearer communication during discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

### Canonical Everything
A core Naomi-ism is to "canonical everything," especially regarding project documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. There should be one canonical document for every project, serving as the central source of information that links to all other relevant documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>.

A canonical document should include:
*   **Work Streams and Owners:** Discrete areas of work (work streams) with a clearly defined single-threaded owner (formerly "directly responsible individual" or "DRI") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>. This recurses for sub-workstreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.
*   **Process:** The established process for how the team works together, including canonical meetings, email lists, and chat groups, to avoid redundant communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.
*   **Canonical Visuals:** Visual representations of frameworks used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.

### Simplifying Complex Problems
When tackling complex or "gnarly" projects, Naomi focuses on simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This means identifying the most basic building blocks of a problem and then gradually revealing additional complexity as understanding deepens. This is akin to creating a "school pyramid" of curriculum, starting at a kindergarten level and progressing to a PhD level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Often, this simplification process helps identify the most critical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>.

Naomi believes that 80% of project challenges stem from people or process issues, not strategy or execution issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. Her priority is to ensure perfect execution, as only then can the true effectiveness of the strategy be evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. This emphasis on process ultimately aims to simplify, reduce meetings, increase clarity, and enable faster progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

## Running Great Meetings

Naomi considers meetings to be high-value and high-cost, striving for maximum productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>. Her meeting strategies include:
*   **Pre-Reads:** Sending a pre-read agenda 24 hours before the meeting, sometimes canceling meetings if it's not provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. Pre-reads enable participants to come prepared and often resolve questions beforehand through comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>.
*   **Facilitated Discussion:** Starting meetings by allowing attendees to read the pre-read (if not done beforehand) and then opening for questions, rather than re-presenting information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.
*   **Decision Focus:** Clearly defining if the meeting is for a decision, requiring three options and a recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
*   **Real-time Documentation:** Editing the projected visual during the meeting to document agreed-upon options and next steps, ensuring immediate clarity and avoiding post-meeting confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.
*   **Post-Meeting Notes:** Sending meeting notes, decisions, and next steps via "reply all" to the calendar invite within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.
*   **Traffic Light Evaluation:** For evaluating options, using a "traffic light" table instead of pros and cons lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. Options are rows, criteria (e.g., legal, policy, product perspective, or user experience, engineering feasibility) are columns, and cells are color-coded (red, yellow, green) to visually represent how options stack up against criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Personal Development and Well-being

Naomi Gleit highlights the importance of personal well-being for professional performance. Her "four must-haves" are:
*   **Eat:** Focusing on protein consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.
*   **Sleep:** Prioritizing sleep hygiene, including using an 8 Sleep mattress, eye masks, and blackout shades to ensure truly dark sleep environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Alone Time:** As an introvert, she needs solo time to recharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.
*   **Exercise:** A non-negotiable daily morning workout, viewing life and work as a physical endeavor requiring fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. She once set a goal to do five pull-ups, which taught her she could "do hard things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. Exercise provides significant mental health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>.

She schedules dedicated two-to-three-hour blocks for deep thinking and developing a "first-party perspective" on strategies and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:59">[01:22:59]</a>. This time can be spent alone or with one or two trusted sparring partners, which helps her clarify her thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.

## Mark Zuckerberg's Leadership Lessons
Naomi observes that Mark Zuckerberg has evolved significantly, particularly in his public presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. She describes him as a "learn-it-all, not a know-it-all," noting his rapid upskilling in various areas, from learning Chinese to MMA, and professional skills like public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>. She believes the public is now seeing the Mark she has known for 20 years, with the gap between public perception and his true self closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.

Zuckerberg is also described as a thoughtful friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. Naomi shared an anecdote where he encouraged her to volunteer teach a class on building a business in East Palo Alto during a difficult time in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. In this class, Mark shared four life lessons:
1.  Love yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
2.  Only then can you truly serve others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>.
3.  Focus on what you can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.
4.  For those things, never give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

### The Small Group
Zuckerberg manages Meta's vast organization (86,000 employees) through a "small group" – a leadership team of key executives working on the company's most important projects, independent of reporting structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. This group is characterized by:
*   **Tenure:** Many members, like Naomi, have been at the company for a long time, motivating them by mission rather than corporate ladder climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Disagreeable Givers:** Members are primarily "disagreeable givers" – individuals who are motivated by what's best for the company but are willing to push back or say unpopular things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This fosters a culture of direct and honest feedback, which Mark actively cultivates to maintain an accurate feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Meeting Structure:** The group holds one weekly strategic, open-ended meeting for discussion, and one weekly highly structured operational meeting to review priority projects and updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

## Lessons from the Growth Team
Naomi was part of Facebook's early growth team, which is considered legendary in tech for developing core growth levers and techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

Key takeaways from the growth team:
*   **Activation Metric:** The team focused on an activation metric of users getting "seven friends in 10 days" (or "10 friends in 14 days") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. This metric correlated strongly with retention, indicating a "magic moment" where users realized the value of Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Importance of Retention:** Early on, the team discovered that churn and resurrection of users were larger levers for net growth than new user acquisition, shifting focus from acquisition to [[Product management skills and best practices | engagement and retention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven, Product-Driven Growth:** The growth team pioneered a data-driven, product-driven approach to growth, moving away from traditional marketing or communications-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. They emphasized that product itself is the biggest lever for growth, focusing on optimizing flows like registration, invites, and new user onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Understand, Identify, Execute Framework:** In 2009, the growth team paused roadmap development to instrument data, leading to a deep understanding of user drop-offs in flows. This allowed them to identify key growth opportunities and then execute by building products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Removing Barriers to Growth:** The growth team's projects aimed at removing both macro and micro barriers to adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.
    *   **Macro Barriers:** Expanding access to Facebook beyond college students to high school students, work networks, and eventually anyone with an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This included efforts like making Facebook accessible on feature phones or through initiatives like internet.org to provide internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
    *   **Micro Barriers:** Optimizing product flows to reduce friction, such as allowing unconfirmed accounts to receive notifications, and counting clicks on any notification as account confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
*   **Product-Led Social Impact:** The data-driven, product-driven approach was extended beyond growth to areas like social impact. Instead of a traditional corporate social responsibility wing, they built a product that enabled the community to raise billions of dollars for charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Similarly, for translations, instead of professional translators, they built an in-line translation tool allowing the community to contribute, supporting over 100 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
*   **New User Onboarding:** The need for onboarding became apparent as Facebook expanded beyond college students. The team developed a new user experience to guide users to "magic moments" like finding friends and uploading a profile picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

## Current Projects: Teen Accounts
Naomi recently worked on "Teen Accounts," a complex, cross-functional project at Meta, involving nearly every team and function (Instagram, central youth team, legal, policy, comms, marketing, product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. This project simplifies and standardizes safety settings for teens on Instagram, automatically putting all users under 16 into the safest settings by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. For example, tens of millions of public teen accounts will be transitioned to private unless parental permission is granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. The North Star for this project is empowering parents, as every child is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>. Naomi believes the ideal solution for age verification across apps would be for platform owners like Apple and Google to make verified age information available to developers, rather than each app trying to verify age independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

## Insights and Takeaways

*   **Pressure is Privilege:** A favorite life motto is "pressure is privilege," which reminds her to be grateful for the opportunities that bring challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:12">[01:33:12]</a>.
*   **Learning through Suffering:** Another motto is "learning through suffering," acknowledging the inherent difficulties in entrepreneurial and high-stakes endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.
*   **Stand Up Into the Fear:** From surfing, Naomi learned that when facing fear, the safest and most productive action is to "stand up into the fear" and commit, rather than hesitate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>.
*   **Product-Market Fit is Key:** While growth efforts are important, Naomi acknowledges that a significant part of Facebook's success was due to having a product with strong product-market fit and high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
*   **Simplicity and Clarity:** A master of a topic achieves "profound simplicity" by being able to explain complex subjects at various levels of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>. This is exemplified by Yuval Noah Harari's ability to synthesize human history in books like *Sapiens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:52">[01:26:52]</a>.
*   **PM Role - CEO of the Product:** While controversial, Naomi aligns with the idea that Product Managers should think of themselves as the "CEO of the product," not in terms of direct authority over people, but as the closest channel for the CEO's vision, optimizing for business goals and user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>. This involves developing a strong first-party perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.
