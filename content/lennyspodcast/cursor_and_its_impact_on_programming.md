From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Cursor, developed by Any Sphere, is a leading AI code editor at the forefront of transforming how engineers and product teams build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. It is one of the fastest-growing products of all time, reaching $100 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in just 20 months and $300 million ARR within two years of launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere, envisions Cursor as a tool for a world "after code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## The Vision: A World After Code

Cursor's goal is to invent a new type of programming—a fundamentally different way to build software that moves beyond traditional coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Michael Tru predicts that being an engineer will increasingly resemble being a [[the_future_of_engineering_and_code_development | logic designer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The focus will shift to specifying intent for how software should work and look, rather than painstakingly writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This vision diverges from two common perspectives on the [[the_future_of_software_development_beyond_traditional_coding | future of software development]]:
*   **Traditional Code Persists**: The idea that software building will remain largely the same, involving text editing in formal programming languages like TypeScript, Go, C, or Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Cursor's team disagrees, believing technology will get "much, much, much better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Chatbot-style Interaction**: The belief that users will simply type commands into a bot to build and modify software, similar to a chatbot or Slackbot interacting with an engineering department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Cursor's team argues this approach lacks precision for users to have complete control over software appearance and function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The "after code" world, as envisioned by Cursor, will feature a representation of software logic that looks more like English, possibly in a document form or an evolution of programming languages towards pseudocode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This higher-level, more concise, and human-readable representation will be easier to navigate than millions of lines of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Crucially, the human will remain in the driver's seat, maintaining significant control and the ability to make changes very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Shifting Skillsets for the Future of Engineering
In this evolving landscape, Michael Tru believes that "taste" will become increasingly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. While often associated with visuals (UI/UX), taste will also apply to the logic of how software works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Engineers will become "logic designers," focusing more on the "what" (specifying intent) and less on the "how" (under-the-hood implementation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This shift implies a move away from the current emphasis on "carefulness" in software engineering toward an increased importance of "taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

While "vibe coding" (generating code without fully understanding details) is related, it currently leads to problems like limited control and unchangeable large codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Cursor aims to address this by allowing continued human control over details even when not fully understanding the underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. "Taste" here refers to having the right idea for what should be built, with the AI effortlessly translating that vision into a working product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Cursor's Origin Story and Path to Success

Cursor emerged from a "solution search of a problem," driven by reflections on how [[AIs_impact_on_software_development | AI]] would improve over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Key Inspirations**:
    *   Using the first beta version of GitHub Copilot, which proved to be a "really, really, really useful" AI product and one of the most useful dev tools adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   OpenAI's scaling papers, which showed AI could improve simply by scaling models and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This suggested the possibility of robust [[ais_impact_on_product_development_and_skills | AI products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Initial Misstep**: Michael and his co-founders initially pursued automating mechanical engineering, believing it would be "uncompetitive and sleepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. However, they lacked domain expertise, struggled with data acquisition for custom models, and ultimately weren't passionate about the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Pivot to Programming**: They realized that despite the passage of time, the programming field hadn't changed much, and existing players weren't sufficiently ambitious about how AI would transform software creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This observation, combined with the "high ceiling" for innovation in AI-powered tools, led them to build Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

### Why the IDE Path?
Cursor chose to build a full [[the_significance_of_aidriven_ides_like_cursor_in_the_software_industry | AI-driven IDE]] rather than just an AI agent or a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This decision was based on several principles:
*   **Human Control**: A core belief that humans should retain control over all decisions in the final product, contrasting with visions of full AI automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **Realism about AI**: A pragmatic view of current AI technology, acknowledging its "massive issues" despite magical capabilities in some areas. This mandates the human in the driver's seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Limitations of Plugins**: The conviction that programming will change significantly, and existing coding environments have "so, so, so limited" extensibility to accommodate these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. To change the UI and form factor of programming, full control over the application is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

While Cursor operates as an IDE, Michael Tru believes the future will involve seamlessly moving between different modes, including AI agents working in the background (e.g., in Slack or an issue tracker) and quickly pulling in AI's work for rapid human iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Tasks with clear specifications and correctness, like bug fixes, are particularly suited for background AI assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

### Key to Historic Growth
Cursor's rapid growth is attributed to several factors:
*   **Dogfooding**: The team intensely used the tool daily during development and only shipped features useful to themselves as engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This instilled realism about the technology's current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Public Building**: The first prototype was hand-rolled in roughly three months, and after five weeks of internal use, it was put into a short beta period before launching to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. An early pivot to basing Cursor on VS Code (like Chromium for browsers) was motivated by initial user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Consistent Improvement**: The growth has been a "consistent exponential" driven by continuous evolution of the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. The team maintains a "sustained paranoia" about how the product can get better, always feeling "very, very far away" from their end goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
*   **Product-Led Growth**: Instead of focusing heavily on sales and marketing initially, Cursor prioritized building a product that the team liked and adjusted it based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.
*   **New Form of Product Building**: Cursor operates as an "intipary" company, blending a traditional software company with a foundation model company, balancing product excellence with scientific advancement in models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

## The Role of Custom Models and Defensibility

Counterintuitively, Cursor, despite initially planning to rely on external foundation models, performs "a ton of model development" internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Every "magic moment" in Cursor now involves a custom model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

*   **Reasons for Custom Models**:
    *   **Cost and Speed**: Foundation models can be too expensive or slow for certain use cases, like real-time autocomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. Cursor's autocomplete, which predicts the next 5-30 minutes of a developer's work across multiple files, requires completions within 300 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.
    *   **Specialty Use Cases**: Custom models are trained for specific tasks that foundation models aren't optimized for, such as autocompleting a series of diffs (predicting added/deleted code changes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Complementing Foundation Models**: Custom models also sit "on the input" and "on the output" of larger foundation models (like Sonnet, Gemini, GPT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.
        *   **Input Side**: They act as a "mini Google search" to find relevant parts of a codebase to show to a big model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
        *   **Output Side**: They take high-level "sketches" or suggestions from smart models and fill in the details, turning them into full code diffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

This "ensemble of models" approach, leveraging the strengths and mitigating the weaknesses of both open-source (like LLaMA) and closed-source models, is a key aspect of Cursor's technology stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

### Moats and Defensibility in AI
Michael Tru believes that in the [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development | AI software development]] space, defensibility is less about traditional "lock-in" (like Salesforce contracts) and more about continuous innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
*   **High Ceiling for Innovation**: The market for AI-powered tools has an "incredibly high ceiling," meaning there are always more useful things to build, unlike some commoditized software markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Ease of Switching**: Users can easily try out different tools and switch to the most innovative product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.
*   **Feedback Loops**: Having distribution (users) helps tune algorithms and learning based on data and feedback, similar to search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Consumer-like Mode**: Success hinges on consistently building the best product so people choose to stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. This leads to "economies of scale of R&D" where investments in technology continue to yield value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

Tru believes the market is "much bigger than people have realized" and predicts there will be one company that builds the "general tool that builds almost all the world's software," which will be a "generationally big business," alongside various niche solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.

### Why Microsoft/Copilot isn't "Winning"
Despite Microsoft's early position with Copilot and immense resources, Michael Tru observes they are not currently winning. He cites two reasons:
*   **Structural Reason (Market Unfriendliness to Incumbents)**: The AI market is not conducive to incumbents because there's so much to do, and it's easy for users to switch products that offer significant innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
*   **Historical Reasons**: The original Copilot team largely dispersed, and coordinating across various departments within a large organization to create such a product has proven difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

## Tips for New Cursor Users

To succeed with Cursor, users need to develop a "taste" for what the AI models can and cannot do, understanding their capabilities and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.
1.  **Chop Up Tasks**: Instead of trying to give the model one large, detailed instruction for a big task, break it into smaller bits. Specify a little, get a little work done, review, and then specify a little more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. This iterative approach is more effective than attempting a single, comprehensive prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
2.  **Experiment in a Safe Environment**: Developers, especially those used to existing workflows, should explicitly try to "fall on their face" and discover the limits of the models in a safe environment, such as a side project, rather than professional work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>. This helps overcome underestimation of AI's abilities and build a "gut feeling" for what the model can achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.

## [[developer_productivity_improvement | Impact of AI on Software Development]] and Engineering Careers

Cursor benefits both junior and senior engineers, though they exhibit different anti-patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. Junior engineers tend to over-rely on AI wholesale, which isn't yet feasible for complex professional tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. Senior engineers, on average, tend to underrate what AI can do for them and stick to existing workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

Michael Tru believes that engineers will continue to be needed, and in fact, more so in the future. The demand for software is "very lasting" and currently far outstrips what can be built due to the high cost and labor intensity of current methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>. If the cost of building software can be brought down by orders of magnitude, there will be "tons and tons and tons of more stuff" to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. The shift will be that engineers can do "much more" by focusing on the "what" rather than the "how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

## Company Building Lessons

### Hiring
Michael Tru admits that Cursor initially "hired too slow" despite trying to be patient and seeking world-class engineers and researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. They learned that the right profile wasn't always the "high credential, straight out of central casting" young person, but often later-career individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

Key hiring insights include:
*   **Qualities**: Seeking intellectual curiosity, experimentation (for new things), and intellectual honesty/micro-pessimism (to cut through noise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   **Two-Day Work Test**: A "surprising staying power" method where candidates spend two days onsite working on a real, mock project in Cursor's codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. This allows the team to see a real work product, assess collaboration, and for candidates to meet the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This helps in assessing "do you want to be around this person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

Cursor, currently around 60 people, maintains a very high percentage of engineers, researchers, and designers compared to other functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.

### Staying Focused Amidst AI Hype
Running a company at the "white-hot center" of AI, where new things launch daily, requires strategic focus. Key strategies include:
*   **Hiring Disposition**: Hiring people who are less focused on external validation and more on building something great and doing high-quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Talking about focus frequently within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.
*   **Leading by Example**: Founders modeling focused behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.
*   **Building an Immune System**: Recognizing that while there's constant chatter, only a few developments truly impact the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. Michael Tru notes that much of AI's progress comes from "very simple elegant ideas" that have staying power, while many others don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

## Common Misunderstandings About AI's Future

Michael Tru believes people still misunderstand the [[ais_impact_on_startups_and_product_development | future of AI]] by being too extreme in their predictions—either expecting it to happen "very fast" or dismissing it as "bluster and hype" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.

*   **Long-Term Shift**: He asserts that AI represents an "incredibly consequential" technology shift, more so than the internet or the advent of computers, but it will take "decades" to unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.
*   **Layered Progress**: Progress requires solving independent problems on both the science side (faster, cheaper, smarter models, new modalities, real-world actions) and the human experience side (how humans control and interact with these systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Specialized Automation Companies**: Companies that focus on automating and augmenting a particular area of knowledge work (like Cursor in software) will be highly consequential. They will build both the underlying technology (integrating and sometimes developing models in-house) and the product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>. As they scale, they will also drive technological progress due to the valuable feedback and data they collect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

This perspective emphasizes a future where AI leads to profound, but gradual, transformations across various knowledge work domains, driven by specialized companies deeply integrating AI into product experiences. This ongoing process of innovation is also informed by studying the history of past technological shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.

For those interested in joining Cursor, roles are available across engineering, design, research, and business, with a focus on continuing to build the best product and growing the user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Interested individuals can find more information at Cursor's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.
