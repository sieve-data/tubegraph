[[differentiated_value_in_marketing | Differentiated value]] is a critical component of effective product positioning, especially for B2B tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It defines how a product is the best in the world at delivering specific value that a well-defined set of companies care deeply about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## The Importance of Positioning and Differentiated Value

Many B2B tech companies struggle with positioning, often asking if their homepage accurately conveys their product's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, what truly matters is whether the product's description resonates with its target buyers, making them immediately understand its relevance and desire it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. If a product isn't performing well, the issue might not be the product itself, but rather its weak positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

April Dunford, author of "Obviously Awesome," is a leading expert on product positioning, having led teams at seven successful B2B startups and assisted over 200 companies in perfecting their positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Her experience highlights that when positioning is done incorrectly, "everything sucks," but when it's right, it leads to significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Signs of Weak Positioning

Weak positioning can negatively impact every stage of the sales pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>:
*   **Marketing Sluggishness** People don't respond to marketing as they should because they don't grasp what the product is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Delayed Understanding in Sales** During sales calls, the buyer might not understand the product's value until after multiple conversations with a sales representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Customer Confusion or Misunderstanding** Buyers might ask the sales representative to "back up and pitch it to me again" due to confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, or they might mistakenly categorize the product as something it's not (e.g., "you're just like Salesforce") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of Perceived Value** Customers might understand what the product does but fail to see why they would pay for it (e.g., "I can do that in a spreadsheet") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **High Churn** Even if deals close, customers may churn because the product doesn't meet their expectations or deliver the value they thought it would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Internal Misalignment** A common cause of weak positioning is a lack of alignment across different teams (e.g., founder, marketing, sales, product) on the product's true positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

When positioning is effective, it feels "obvious" and simple, making customers think, "Of course, that's what it is! Of course, we need one of those!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## The Process of Developing Differentiated Value

April Dunford outlines a structured approach to developing [[differentiated_value_in_marketing | differentiated value]] as part of a comprehensive positioning exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>:

### 1. Identify Competitive Alternatives
The first step is to understand what your product must "beat" to win a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This includes:
*   **Status Quo:** What the customer is currently doing to solve the problem, even if it's inefficient (e.g., spreadsheets, pen and paper, interns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. In B2B, roughly 40% of deals are lost to "no decision," which often means losing to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
*   **Shortlist Competitors:** Other products or services that a potential customer would consider when making a purchasing decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

### 2. List Differentiated Capabilities
Once alternatives are clear, identify what unique capabilities your product possesses that competitors do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. This can include features, functions, or even company capabilities like pricing or professional services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

### 3. Translate Capabilities into Value Themes
Map these differentiated capabilities to the value they provide for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. This process often reveals two or three main "value buckets" or themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. This method ensures the identified value is truly [[differentiated_value_in_marketing | differentiated]] and not just generally valuable things that competitors could also offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

### 4. Define Best-Fit Customers
Determine the characteristics of target accounts that would care most about the unique value your product offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Not all companies will value the same thing equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. This step helps define your ideal customer profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

### 5. Establish Market Category
The final step is to define the market category in which to position your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. The ideal market category is one that makes your [[differentiated_value_in_marketing | differentiated value]] obvious to your best-fit customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

This entire process is a "team sport," ideally involving marketing, product, sales, customer success, and executive leadership, including the CEO, to ensure alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. The output is not just a document of bullet points, but a compelling sales narrative that can be tested with qualified prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>.

## Example: Help Scout

Help Scout, a growth-stage startup in the customer success software market, demonstrates this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.
1.  **Competitive Alternatives:** They compete with large players like Zendesk, but also with basic solutions like email or rudimentary shared inboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
2.  **Differentiated Capabilities:** Help Scout offers features focused on delivering exceptional customer service, such as a proper service-oriented shared inbox, assigning a person (not a ticket number) to customer issues, and only displaying a chatbot when a real person is available to chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
3.  **Value Themes:** Their core [[differentiated_value_in_marketing | differentiated value]] is enabling businesses to provide amazing customer service that deepens customer relationships and drives growth through customer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
4.  **Best-Fit Customers:** Companies that care deeply about this value are typically direct-to-consumer (DTC) or e-commerce brands, for whom customer service is a primary interaction point with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. This differentiates them from, for example, phone companies that primarily view customer service as a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
5.  **Sales Narrative:** Help Scout's story starts by emphasizing that "customer success is a growth driver" for modern e-commerce companies, contrasting this with alternatives that treat it as a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Positioning vs. Messaging vs. Branding

These terms are often confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>:
*   **Positioning** is a fundamental input that defines how your product wins in the market against alternatives and for whom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. It's about figuring out your [[differentiated_value_in_marketing | differentiation]] and target buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.
*   **Messaging** is the text or communication used on platforms like a homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. It flows *out* of positioning; you cannot effectively write messaging until positioning is understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
*   **Branding** is about what you want your brand to stand for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. Like messaging, it requires positioning to be figured out first to ensure the brand is distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## When to Focus on Positioning

For very early-stage products, it's often better to start with a "positioning thesis" – a set of assumptions about competitors, [[differentiated_value_in_marketing | differentiated value]], target customers, and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. This thesis is usually partially incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. In the early days, it's advisable to keep positioning "a little bit loose" and allow the market to guide you, like a fishing net cast for "all kinds of big fish" rather than just "tuna" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.

The time to "tighten up" positioning and "smash your foot on the gas" is when a clear pattern emerges regarding who loves your product and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This means identifying common characteristics among your best customers, even if they initially appear diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

## Segmentation vs. Personas

*   **Segmentation** in B2B typically involves splitting a market based on firmographics (e.g., company size, revenue, geography) or specific actionable characteristics (e.g., "companies that have a creative team with more than three people and use this particular software package") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. This helps in [[segmentation_and_productizing_for_different_customer_needs | segmenting for different customer needs]] and creating targeted marketing and sales lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.
*   **Personas** focus on the characteristics of a particular buyer within a company (e.g., "Eric the IT person," "Janet the sales rep") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. In B2B, multiple people (typically five to seven) are involved in a purchasing decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. However, the most crucial persona for positioning is the **champion**—the person whose job it is to build consensus and drive the deal internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. If positioning doesn't resonate with the champion, the deal won't even make it onto a shortlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. The goal is to arm the champion to sell to other stakeholders (IT, purchasing, economic buyer) later in the deal cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. Creating extensive personas for every individual involved in a deal can be a "waste of time" if the champion persona is not thoroughly understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.
