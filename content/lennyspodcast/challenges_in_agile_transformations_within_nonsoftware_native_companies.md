Agile transformations, particularly within large, non-software native organizations like banks, insurance companies, or pharmaceutical companies, present unique [[challenges and pitfalls in product management | challenges]]. These companies often adopt agile methodologies like Scrum and the [[scaled_agile_framework_vs_traditional_methods | Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)]] in an effort to [[innovating_within_large_organizations | innovate]] and build software faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. However, a fundamental misunderstanding of product management and an overly rigid adherence to processes can lead to significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Agile in Non-Tech Companies

Historically, Silicon Valley software companies developed product management roles organically from a business perspective, where software itself was the core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. These product managers engaged in market research, customer interaction, and end-to-end product iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

In contrast, large, non-software native organizations often encountered "product management" through the implementation of Scrum and the introduction of the Product Owner role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Many of these companies traditionally did not grow up building software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. When undergoing digital transformations, they seek frameworks that provide "rigor at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>.

## The Product Owner Role: A Source of Misconception

The Product Owner role emerged from Scrum, an agile framework developed by software developers, not product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. Its original intent was to help developers prioritize work within a Sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, focusing on backlog definition and user story writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.

### The Misconception of the Role
The initial Scrum Guide hinted that a Product Owner *could* be a Product Manager for commercial development, but often envisioned the role as an internal "customer" or user department manager for in-house efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:57]</a>. Later versions removed the explicit mention of Product Managers, leading to widespread misunderstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.

In practice, this often translates to Product Owners becoming "order takers" or highly tactical roles, solely focused on maintaining a full backlog for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:00">[32:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>. They are typically not trained in market research, data analysis, or experimentation—core tenets of traditional product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.

## [[scaled_agile_framework_vs_traditional_methods | SAFe]]: A "Plug-and-Play" Solution with Drawbacks

SAFe, a popular scaled agile framework, originated from a desire to scale Scrum to large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:00">[26:39:00]</a>. Executives at large enterprises are drawn to SAFe because it prescribes a detailed operating model for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:40:00">[36:40:00]</a>. It maps out how to connect multiple agile teams into "release trains" and conduct "Big Room Planning" to commit to quarterly work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>.

### Core Problems with SAFe Implementation
*   **Splitting Product Manager and Product Owner**: SAFe often creates a formal split where Product Managers handle discovery and strategy, while Product Owners are embedded with agile teams and focus on backlog maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>. This leaves Product Owners without exposure to strategic thinking, customer research, or market analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Process over Value**: Organizations can get so caught up in SAFe's prescribed processes (e.g., numerous meetings, constant Sprints) that they lose sight of delivering value to customers and measuring outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:58:00">[31:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strategic Leadership Guidance**: SAFe primarily addresses development processes and doesn't adequately define the roles of product leaders (e.g., Directors, VPs of Product) or how they should engage in portfolio management and overarching product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a>.
*   **Overkill for Smaller Teams**: For startups or small teams, the overhead of rigid frameworks like Scrum or SAFe can be unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>.
*   **Commercial Interests**: Organizations selling agile certifications and consulting services promote these frameworks, sometimes prioritizing training revenue over genuine transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:56:00">[57:56:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] My experience suggests that while some find initial success with SAFe, they often end up "ripping it up and making it into something else," indicating its rigid "by-the-book" application is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:00">[49:31:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and pitfalls in product management | Challenges with Project Management Roles in Product Teams]] & Career Paths

A significant hurdle in these transformations is the [[leadership_and_management_challenges_in_scaling_a_company | leadership and management challenges in scaling a company]] around existing roles and career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:00">[46:58:00]</a>. Often, individuals from backgrounds like project management or business analysis are rebranded as "Product Owners" without comprehensive training in product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] "This product owner role did not emerge from product management as we know it today; it was a way to help the developers prioritize what to work on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>

This creates a split career trajectory: Product Owners are seen as tactical, while Product Managers handle strategy, often reporting to different departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. This means Product Owners gain no strategic experience, limiting their growth into Product Manager roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>. The lack of a clear career path leads to high churn in these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Successful Transformation

For organizations undertaking digital or agile transformations, the focus should be on building a comprehensive product operating model, not just a development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:36:00">[41:36:00]</a>.

### Advice for Leaders
1.  **Define a Product Operating Model**: This involves establishing a clear product strategy, optimizing organizational design around products, implementing product operations to support teams with data and customer access, and aligning culture and incentives with value delivery over mere shipping velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Enable Discovery and Feedback**: Leaders must ensure teams have mechanisms to talk to customers, gather data, and integrate feedback into their planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>. Without this, teams are "just planning, planning, planning" without checking if they're building the right things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:53:00">[33:53:00]</a>.
3.  **Invest in Skilled Talent**: Bring in experienced product leaders (e.g., CPOs, VPs of Product) who understand product strategy and can apply it within the company's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:03:00">[53:03:00]</a>. Mix experienced hires with internal talent to foster learning and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:39:00">[53:39:00]</a>.
4.  **Codify Career Paths**: Establish clear product management career paths (e.g., Associate Product Manager, Product Manager, Senior Product Manager) that allow growth and ensure Product Owners can transition into full Product Manager roles, gaining strategic experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. The best tech companies don't have Product Owners, only Product Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.
5.  **C-Suite Involvement**: Digital transformation is not just an IT project; it's a fundamental shift in how the business operates. The C-Suite must drive this change, understanding that software strategy is deeply intertwined with overall company strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. They need to ask, "What can we do with our software that's going to put us ahead of the competition?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.

### Advice for Product Owners
1.  **Shift Mindset from Process to Value**: Instead of detailing agile cadences on resumes, focus on the value delivered to users and the measurable impact on business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
2.  **Seek Strategic Opportunities**: Actively push back on being an "order taker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:01:00">[58:01:00]</a>. Volunteer to conduct customer research, even if it means stripping back some tactical duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:03:00">[59:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Ask Outcome-Oriented Questions**: Ask leaders, "What's the goal here? When we release this, what do we hope will happen? What metrics are we going to change?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:31:00">[59:31:00]</a> This helps align the organization on outcomes.
4.  **Question Career Paths**: Ask leaders about your career path within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a>. This awareness can prompt the organization to address the issue.
5.  **Be Skeptical of Certifications**: While some large enterprises may require or value certifications like CSPO (Certified Scrum Product Owner), they are often obtained from short classes and do not guarantee the ability to perform complex product management tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. Top tech companies prioritize experience over certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.
6.  **Consider Internal or External Moves**: If growth opportunities are consistently absent, consider moving to a different, more product-mature division internally or seeking opportunities at organizations that genuinely embrace product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

## Conclusion

The core principle of agile—moving quickly and delivering great value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>—should guide any transformation. Rigid processes, especially when sold by external consultants with commercial interests, often lead to an "overkill" that detracts from actual product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.

Instead of blindly following frameworks, organizations should "inspect and adapt" their processes to ensure they serve the best interests of the company, its culture, and its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>. It is entirely possible for large, non-software native companies to build amazing products by fostering a true product mindset, integrating experienced talent, and providing clear growth paths for their product professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.
