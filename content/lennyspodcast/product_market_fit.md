[[productmarket_fit_framework | Product market fit]] is a critical concept in the startup world, signifying that a product has found a market where it resonates strongly with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It indicates that the product is a "must-have" for its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Sean Ellis Test (Product Market Fit Test)

The [[product_market_fit_strategies_by_rahul_vohra | Sean Ellis Test]], also known as the [[productmarket_fit_framework | Product Market Fit Test]], is a simple question designed to help determine if a product has [[productmarket_fit_framework | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. It asks: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

Respondents are given the following choices:
*   Very disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>
*   Somewhat disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>
*   Not disappointed or not applicable (I've already stopped using the product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>

The goal is to identify users who would be "very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

### The 40% Threshold
A commonly cited threshold is 40% or more of users saying they would be "very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This percentage emerged from observing a pattern across many startups in Silicon Valley: products that hit this percentage generally performed well, while those that fell too low tended to suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

The 40% threshold is considered a "leading indicator" of [[productmarket_fit_framework | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. The "lagging indicator" or ultimate test is actual user retention—whether people continue using the product over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The test's value lies in providing early insight without needing a sophisticated analytics system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

Some companies, like Nubank, use a 50% threshold, particularly in cultures where respondents might be overly optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>. Nubank even applies this test at the feature level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>.

### When to Administer the Test
It's recommended to survey a random sample of users who have genuinely used the product, ideally having experienced the "activation moment" and used it two or more times within the last week or two, before they churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:05]</a>. A sample size of at least 30 responses is generally considered a minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:23:00]</a>.

### Interpreting and Acting on Results (Strategies for Achieving Product Market Fit)
The most valuable use of the [[productmarket_fit_framework | Sean Ellis Test]] is to **deeply understand the users who would be "very disappointed"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

Key questions to ask these users:
*   Who considers the product a "must-have"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>
*   How are they using the product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>
*   What did they use before? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>
*   What problem are they solving? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>
*   What is the primary benefit they get from the product? (Start with an open-ended question, then use multiple-choice, followed by "Why is that benefit important to you?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. This helps uncover the core problem and context (e.g., "drowning in email" for a mail organizer like Zinbox) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.
*   What would you use instead if this product were no longer available? (Often, users who are "somewhat disappointed" can easily identify alternatives, indicating a lack of uniqueness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:59:00">[44:59:00]</a>.

Based on these insights, [[strategies_for_achieving_productmarket_fit | strategies for achieving product market fit]] include:
*   **Repositioning the product:** Focus marketing and messaging on the most valued features and benefits identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   **Streamlining onboarding:** Guide new users directly to the most valued features or the "aha moment" to accelerate their "time to value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.
*   **Optimizing the product roadmap:** Double down on features important to "must-have" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting the right customers:** Focus acquisition efforts on people who have the identified need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.

### Ignoring "Somewhat Disappointed" Users
Initially, Sean Ellis advised ignoring users who say they would be "somewhat disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:25:00">[25:25:00]</a>. These users often perceive the product as a "nice-to-have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>. Focusing on their feedback could dilute the product's core value for the "must-have" users, making it "good for everyone but not great for anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">[42:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:17:00">[42:17:00]</a>.

However, companies like Superhuman found a nuanced approach: identify the core benefit for "must-have" users, then ask "somewhat disappointed" users who also care about that benefit what they would need to consider it a "must-have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. This allows improvement without diluting the core offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:00">[42:48:00]</a>.

### Challenges in Achieving Product Market Fit
[[challenges_in_achieving_productmarket_fit | Challenges in achieving product market fit]] are significant, with failure being a common outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:00]</a>. Even with [[productmarket_fit_framework | product market fit]], companies can still fail if they lack strong execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>. A key challenge is ensuring the product brings tangible value to people, beyond just being "cool" technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>.

## Growth After Product Market Fit
Once a product has achieved [[productmarket_fit_framework | product market fit]] (e.g., reaching the 40% threshold), the focus shifts to sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The overarching goal is to enable as many of the right people as possible to have that "must-have" product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>.

### Growth Strategy Framework
The recommended [[strategies_for_achieving_productmarket_fit | growth strategy]] prioritizes internal product improvements over aggressive acquisition:

1.  **Understand Product Value:** Deeply comprehend what makes the product a "must-have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:46:00">[49:46:00]</a>.
2.  **Define a North Star Metric:** Establish a metric that quantifies the "units of value" being delivered to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:53:00">[49:53:00]</a>. This metric should reflect core value, be up-and-to-the-right over time, and correlate with revenue growth (but not necessarily be revenue itself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:50">[1:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:00">[1:21:00]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Airbnb: Nights booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:41">[1:22:41]</a>
    *   Uber: Weekly rides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:23:00">[1:23:00]</a>
    *   Amazon: Monthly purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:25">[1:21:25]</a>
    *   Eventbrite: Weekly tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:24:15">[1:24:15]</a>
    *   Dropbox: Files accessed (hypothetical, as they were before the term North Star was common) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:24:06">[1:24:06]</a>
3.  **Optimize the Value Delivery Engine:** Diagram and improve all stages of the user journey, starting with [[stages_of_productmarket_fit | activation]] and onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:34:00">[50:34:00]</a>.
4.  **Prioritize Improvements:** Identify high-leverage opportunities and run experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:53:00">[50:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Activation (Onboarding):** This is often the most critical initial focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">[51:03:00]</a>. New users are at high risk of churning if they don't quickly experience the product's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:59:00">[53:59:00]</a>. Fixing onboarding significantly impacts retention and the efficiency of acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:49:00">[55:49:00]</a>. For example, LogMeIn increased its signup-to-usage rate by 1,000% in three months by focusing solely on onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>.
        *   **Strategy:** Understand *why* users drop off (e.g., asking "Why didn't you download the software?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:43:00">[58:43:00]</a>, increase desire, reduce friction, and provide clear messaging about benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:02">[1:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:40">[1:01:40]</a>.
    *   **Engagement:** Maximize usage based on the product's natural cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:27">[1:17:27]</a>.
    *   **Referral:** If there's already strong word-of-mouth, an incentivized referral program (like Dropbox's) can accelerate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:15:15">[1:15:15]</a>.
    *   **Monetization:** Optimize the revenue model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:10">[1:19:10]</a>.
5.  **Aggressive Customer Acquisition:** Only once the internal engine (activation, engagement, monetization) is efficient should a company "obsess" over acquiring new customers at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:41:00">[51:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:58:00">[52:58:00]</a>. This helps avoid wasting money on channels that don't convert or retain users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20:00">[53:20:00]</a>.

### Identifying and Targeting Best Fit Customers
To [[identifying_and_targeting_best_fit_customers | identify and target best fit customers]], engage in qualitative research:
*   Talk to customers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:16">[1:10:16]</a>.
*   Ask how they found the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:19">[1:10:19]</a>.
*   Ask how they typically find similar products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:22">[1:10:22]</a>.
This provides insights into potential acquisition channels, categorizing them as "demand generation" (creating new demand, like seeing a sign) or "demand harvesting" (capturing existing demand, like search) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:48">[1:06:48]</a>.

## Evolution of Growth Strategies
In the past, simply being data and test-driven for customer acquisition was enough to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:17">[1:25:17]</a>. Today, most online marketers are data-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:44">[1:25:44]</a>, making it harder to be competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:51">[1:25:51]</a>. Now, companies must be highly efficient across *all* parts of the business—converting, retaining, and monetizing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:54">[1:25:54]</a>. This requires significant cross-functional collaboration between marketing, product, sales, and customer success teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:26:18">[1:26:18]</a>.

The ability to ask the "right question at the right time" is paramount in figuring things out, whether it's understanding [[the_importance_of_productmarket_fit_and_customer_feedback | customer feedback]] or identifying growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:33:14">[1:33:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:34:06">[1:34:06]</a>.
