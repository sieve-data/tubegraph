From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Uri Levine, co-founder of [[ways | Waze]] and nine other companies, has built two unicorns and served on over 20 startup boards, advising more than 50 founders and startups throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He summarized his extensive experience in his book, "Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, hailed it as a "Bible" for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Fall in Love with the Problem

Levine's central [[philosophy_and_entrepreneurship | philosophy]] is to "fall in love with the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This means:
*   **Value Creation:** The simplest way to create value is by solving a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **North Star:** The problem serves as the "north star" for the startup's journey, minimizing deviation and increasing the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Compelling Story:** Focusing on the problem makes the company's story more compelling. For instance, instead of saying "I'm going to build an AI crowdsourced navigation system," say "I'm going to help you avoid traffic jams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. When customers care, they want you to succeed and will help you achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Widespread Problem:** Start with a big problem that is "worth solving" and will make the world a better place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. If only one person has the problem, get a therapist, don't build a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **User Perception First:** Speak with potential users to understand their perception of the problem *before* building a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Starting with a solution risks building something nobody cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Passion is Key:** The entrepreneurial journey is "hard and complex and long," so founders must be personally passionate about the problem. Lack of passion means insufficient internal drive to overcome hardships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Once you're in love with the problem, the goal is to engage everyone else to fall in love with it and follow your [[importance_of_founderled_growth_strategies | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Validating a Problem

To determine if a problem is big enough, Levine advises:
*   Speak with at least 20 people you don't know (aim for 100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   A true problem will elicit a response like, "no, no, no, this is not the problem, the problem is..." where they offer their own description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   Personal frustration is a common starting point for his own ventures, such as his hatred for traffic jams, which led to [[ways | Waze]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## The Startup Journey: A Multi-Dimensional Path

Levine describes the startup journey as multi-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>:

### 1. A Rollercoaster Journey
*   Startups experience ups and downs with much higher frequency and dramatic differences than established businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Ben Horowitz's quote, "I woke up every two hours and cried," accurately reflects the reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### 2. A Journey of Failures
*   Building something new means you will fail, often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Embrace Failure:** If you're afraid to fail, you've already failed because you won't try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. As Michael Jordan said, "I've failed over and over and over again and this is what made me successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   **Fail Fast:** This allows for more attempts and iterations, increasing the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. The more shots you take, the more likely you are to score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Good Enough is Perfect:** Don't strive for perfection; iterate until your product is "good enough" to win the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### 3. A Long Journey
*   The journey is much longer than anticipated, especially the phase of figuring out [[elements_of_breakthrough_startup_ideas_inflections_insights_founder_future_fit | Product-Market Fit]] (PMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## Achieving Product-Market Fit (PMF)

[[elements_of_breakthrough_startup_ideas_inflections_insights_founder_future_fit | Product-Market Fit]] is about creating value for your customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Without it, a company will die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
*   **Core Product Stability:** Once PMF is achieved, the core product typically doesn't change much (e.g., Google search, [[ways | Waze]] navigation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   **Timeframe:** Achieving PMF can take years—4 years for [[ways | Waze]], 5 for Microsoft, 10 for Netflix, and 6 years for ChatGPT before public awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   **Key Metric: Retention:** The single most important metric for PMF is retention. If users come back, you're creating value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. For high-frequency-of-use products, 3-month retention of 30-50% is a good indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. Users often "convert" and demonstrate value around their third or fourth use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
*   **Waze's PMF Journey:** [[ways | Waze]] launched globally at the end of 2009 but wasn't "good enough" in most places. Through over a year of "iteration after iteration," talking to drivers and addressing feedback, they started seeing retention in specific metropolitan areas (e.g., Los Angeles) and countries (e.g., Italy, Colombia) by early 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Notably, it didn't work in Japan due to its complex chronological house numbering system, which [[ways | Waze]]'s crowdsourced map data couldn't perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

## Startup Phases and Focus

Levine emphasizes the importance of focus in different startup phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>:
*   **"All Over the Place" Phase:** Initially, founders think about everything. The challenge is to execute one thing at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
*   **Phase 1: Figure out PMF:** This is the primary focus. At this stage, you don't need sales, business development, or even much marketing. The focus is on product development with developers and a product lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Phases:** Once PMF is achieved, the company shifts focus to figuring out how to grow the business and determine the business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.
    *   **Business Model:** If you create value, you will find a business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. [[ways | Waze]] initially thought they'd sell map data but ended up with advertising due to long sales cycles with governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
    *   **Growth:**
        *   **Word of Mouth:** [[importance_of_founderled_growth_strategies | Word of mouth]] growth is only significant for products with "high frequency of use." For instance, [[ways | Waze]] is used daily, allowing frequent sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. If frequency is low (e.g., annual tax software), [[importance_of_founderled_growth_strategies | word of mouth]] is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.
        *   **"Coolness" Factor:** Highly unique and "cool" products (like early Airbnb) can also achieve strong [[importance_of_founderled_growth_strategies | word of mouth]] even with lower frequency of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.
    *   **Shifting Gears:** Companies must be able to "shift gears" between phases, focusing on product, then marketing/sales, then scale. Failure to do so leads to being stuck in a previous phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **Focus:** "Focus is not about what we're doing, it's about what we are not doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.

## Fundraising Strategies

Levine provides several [[lessons_from_failed_and_successful_investments | lessons from failed and successful investments]] and fundraising experiences:
*   **First Impressions Matter:** Investors often decide if they like a founder "before they sit down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.
*   **Lead with Strength:** Start your presentation with your strongest point, whether it's the problem's size, traction, or team. This is because the first slide will be displayed the longest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. The second most important slide is the "thank you" slide at the end, used to repeat your strongest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.
*   **"I Like the CEO, I Like the Story":** For early-stage investors, their decision often comes down to liking the CEO and their story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.
    *   **CEO Goes Alone:** The CEO should attend investor meetings alone to keep the "headlight" on themselves and avoid distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.
    *   **Emotional Engagement:** A good story creates emotional engagement and a sense that the listener wants to be part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. Investors want to believe the product is usable and that you can build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.
    *   **Start with the Problem:** Investors are users too. If they don't see the relevance or use case for themselves, they may dismiss the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
*   **The "Dance of 100 Nos":** Fundraising success rate is about 1% for investors (they see 100-200 companies and invest in 1-2). Expect to hear "no" 100 times before a "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. Don't argue with a "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

## Hiring and Firing

Levine dedicates a chapter to "Firing and Hiring," emphasizing that firing is the harder, more crucial decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.
*   **Problematic Team Members:** Many startup failures are attributed to the "team not being right" or "communication issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. Founders often know within the first month if someone isn't a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   **CEO's Responsibility:** If a CEO doesn't make hard decisions, top-performing employees will leave because they don't want to be in an organization unable to act decisively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>.
*   **30-Day Rule:** Every time you hire someone new, mark your calendar for 30 days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. Ask yourself: "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>
    *   **Yes:** Express excitement, acknowledge exceeded expectations, and consider more equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>.
    *   **No:** Fire them immediately. They are already on a trajectory of not being successful and are damaging the team and themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.
*   **Seeking Confirmation:** If unsure about a tough decision, ask top performers how they would feel if the person left. Their nonchalance confirms the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. This aligns with Netflix's "Keeper Test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   **General Life Principle:** Apply the "knowing what I know today, would I do something different?" question to all aspects of life. If the answer is yes, then "do something different today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.
*   **Hiring References:** For hiring, always speak to references. Ask a simple question: "Would you hire him/her?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.

## Understanding Users

*   **Diverse Usage:** Users will use your product in ways you didn't expect. Steve Wozniak, for instance, used the iPhone's volume button to take photos, a feature Levine didn't realize was primary for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. Similarly, some [[ways | Waze]] users rely on the screen, others on audio prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.
*   **Don't Assume:** Don't build a product assuming everyone uses it like you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.
*   **Methods to Understand:**
    1.  **Watch Users:** Observe how new users interact with your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.
    2.  **Ask "Why":** If users don't do what you expect, ask them "why?" Their "why" will lead to a more successful product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>.
*   **User Adoption Groups (Bell Curve):**
    *   **Innovators (2%):** Use something new simply because it's new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.
    *   **Early Adopters:** Try a product once they see value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.
    *   **Early Majority (1/3 of population):** This group determines market leaders. They are afraid of change and resistant to new things, often thinking "Don't Rock the Boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. They fear complexity and embarrassment.
    *   **Simplicity is Key:** The solution to attracting the early majority is "simplicity." Add features, but ruthlessly remove those not being used to reduce complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>.
*   **Talk to Failed Users:** To truly improve, don't just talk to successful users (bottom of the funnel). Talk to those who failed to progress in the funnel—those who downloaded but didn't register, or registered but didn't use, or used but didn't come back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>. They hold the "why" that can make your product great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

## General Entrepreneurial Advice

*   **Resilience:** [[resilience_and_perseverance_in_startups | Don't be afraid to fail]]. When you fail and get up, you get up stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>. Teach children to fail so they learn to explore outside their comfort zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.
*   **Openness:** "Accept the fact that we don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.

Uri Levine continues to look for new problems to solve, believing he will "never be done" with starting companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. He is currently involved in companies addressing retirement planning, medical knowledge through AI, and continuing to tackle mobility challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>. His overarching goal in life is "creating value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>.
