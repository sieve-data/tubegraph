Bengali Kaba, with a distinguished career as an early growth Product Manager (PM) at Facebook, Head of Growth at Instagram, VP of Product at Instacart, and now Director of Product Management at YouTube, has significantly impacted various company cultures through his innovative approaches to growth and product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He has also advised numerous startups, including Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. His insights are particularly valuable for anyone looking to excel in product and [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Core Growth Philosophy

Kaba's philosophy centers on driving impact, which he believes is the most crucial output to optimize for in a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Impact directly influences compensation and career leveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For a product manager, impact means driving clarity about product problems and opportunities, focusing prioritization, and consistently delivering results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Understand Work

Kaba champions a concept known as "Understand Work," a framework adopted and shepherded from his time at Facebook to Instagram, Instacart, Twitter, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

He highlights a common [[common_misconceptions_in_growth_strategies | anti-pattern]] he calls "Identify, Justify, Execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. This occurs when a team decides to build something and then retrospectively pulls data to justify it, often leading to unimpactful outcomes despite significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

Instead, the preferred approach is "Understand, Identify, Execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This means starting with a deep, first-principles understanding of the problem or opportunity before identifying solutions and executing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

Understand work is an intentional part of the execution plan, dedicated to de-risking a project and gathering crucial insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. It's explicitly put on the roadmap, not assumed to happen in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. For example, at Instagram, significant "understand work" was done to define what constitutes a "good connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

Understand work can involve:
*   **Data Science:** Pulling funnels, analyzing different user types, defining proxy metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Engineering:** Instrumenting logging to ensure data visibility, refactoring code for scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Product Management:** Dogfooding products, understanding ecosystems, defining partnership strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **User Research:** Gathering feedback, insights from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

This approach creates parallel paths of work, where teams execute on high-conviction items while simultaneously conducting understand work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This leads to a "velocity multiplier" over time, increasing clarity and the win rate of shipped products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. At Instagram, this strategy led to 60-70% of experiments being positive and shippable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

This method suggests slowing down to speed up, leading to more intelligent execution rather than just faster shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. It's about optimizing for long-term gains through a series of short-term, intelligent executions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

### Growth Flywheels

Kaba emphasizes the importance of identifying and nurturing [[effective_growth_frameworks | growth flywheels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. This involves understanding the value proposition at every point of the user experience, especially in a [[marketplace_growth_strategies | multi-sided marketplace]] like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. The goal is to connect the dots in a compelling story that provides clarity and purpose for the teams on what to work on, and what not to work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Adjacent User Theory

A key aspect of Kaba's [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth strategy]], developed at Instagram, is the "Adjacent User Theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. In a hypergrowth product, the user base changes rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The theory suggests understanding:
1.  **Current Users:** Who they are, what motivates them, and why they use the product today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.
2.  **Next Users:** Identifying who could be using the product but isn't, and understanding their unmet needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

This means actively "dogfooding" the product from the perspective of an adjacent user – perhaps by creating a new account or using it in a way a less tech-savvy person might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This helps reveal "obvious opportunities missed" that power users might overlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This theory is mandatory for hypergrowth companies and very helpful for companies seeking to capture more market share by understanding why non-customers aren't buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Real-world Examples of Growth Strategies

### Instagram Growth Loops

Instagram's rapid growth was not solely due to virality. It involved a combination of compounding [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth loops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.
*   **Invitations:** The core component was people inviting others, ensuring these invitations worked well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Partnerships:** A critical, often unspoken, growth funnel was the partnership team working with celebrities, teaching them how to use Instagram to tell their stories and build their brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This strategy was in place even before Kaba joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.
*   **SEO & Embeds:** Celebrity content, picked up by news and media outlets, linked back to Instagram profiles and posts, creating a powerful Search Engine Optimization (SEO) engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. The launch of Instagram's web presence was crucial for SEO and international growth, increasing growth by 10% immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>. Embeds of Instagram content on other sites further boosted SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
*   **Paid Media:** This layered on top of the organic signals, further supercharging the user acquisition engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

These different [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth engines]] compounded each other, magnifying top-of-funnel acquisition while ensuring mid-funnel retention and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.

### Instagram Account Access and Connections Pivot

At Instagram, Kaba's team addressed a significant problem where hundreds of thousands of people daily couldn't log back into their accounts after logging out, especially in regions like South Asia and Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>. This was because users shared phones, used prepaid plans (requiring logout to save background data), or simply forgot complex login details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.

The solutions included:
*   **Omni Box Login:** Combining email, phone number, and handle into a single, simple login field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.
*   **Trusted Device Text Message:** Sending a text message verification after two failed login attempts on a trusted device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.
*   **Save Credentials / Passcode:** Prompting users to save login credentials or set up a passcode upon logout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.

These changes led to a gain of 15-20 million additional monthly active users per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. Critically, this "understand work" also revealed an unexpected insight: solving account access issues led to more content creation, particularly from users accessing second and third accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>. This realization led to the creation of a "multiple accounts" team, which developed the seamless account switching features seen on Instagram today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.

Another pivotal shift at Instagram was the "connections pivot" around 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. Initially, the platform's machine learning optimized for any follow, treating celebrity follows and friend follows equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. However, data showed that while users quickly followed celebrities, their retention would dip after several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>. This was because when new users made their first post, none of their *friends* were following them, leading to a feeling of "posting in an echo chamber" and ultimately churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. The team successfully argued to prioritize "regular human connections" in the first few days of sign-up, ensuring users felt validated and part of a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. This single shift literally doubled Instagram's retention over 1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.

### Instacart Reordering

At Instacart, Kaba observed that despite people often buying the same groceries repeatedly, the app made reordering difficult, requiring many clicks to find previous items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. Data showed that after five orders, 90% of a user's basket was the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. By simplifying the reordering process (e.g., allowing users to select individual items from past orders rather than reordering the whole thing), Instacart could significantly improve retention and drive [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This highlights focusing on the "job to be done" – people want to easily assemble a meal, not just buy individual ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### Facebook People Recommendations in India

As a growth PM for people recommendations at Facebook, Kaba noticed that the platform's people graph in India seemed "broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>. Users had fewer friends in common (e.g., 7 in India vs. 22 in the US) and exhibited high friending/unfriending behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>.

Through on-the-ground "understand work" in India, observing users directly, Kaba learned that Facebook's Western-centric profile fields (like school, job title) were irrelevant for many Indian users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. Common names like "Amit Kumar" further complicated identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. Users often resorted to looking at photos to identify connections, as this was the only relevant information available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This demonstrated that the existing design, based on Western paradigms, did not support the "job to be done" of finding friends in this cultural context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The team had to find creative, culturally sensitive ways to enable connections.

## Common Growth Opportunities

Based on his experience, Kaba finds that most [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth opportunities]] often lie in the **onboarding to habit-building experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. Many teams fail to understand the user's first "aha moment" and how to foster habit formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. While top-of-funnel acquisition is crucial, without strong retention and habit building, a product will merely be a "leaky bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. The goal is to build compounding [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth loops]] (two, three, or four different ways of acquiring users) that layer onto each other and supercharge the engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

## Managing Complex Change

Kaba utilizes a [[product_management_career_growth_framework | framework]] for "Managing Complex Change" when aiming to improve or change team cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. This framework identifies five essential components for successful change:
1.  **Vision:** A clear understanding of the desired future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. (Missing Vision leads to Confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>)
2.  **Skills:** The capabilities required to achieve the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. (Missing Skills leads to Anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>)
3.  **Incentives:** Motivation for individuals and teams to align with the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. (Missing Incentives leads to Resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>)
4.  **Resources:** The necessary tools, budget, and personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. (Missing Resources leads to Frustration)
5.  **Action Plan:** A clear roadmap for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. (Missing Action Plan leads to False Starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>)

When encountering a struggling team, Kaba observes the "symptoms" (confusion, frustration, anxiety, resistance, false starts) to identify which component is missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. Addressing these specific gaps with targeted interventions (e.g., providing a product craft framework for skills, or improving team meeting structures for action plans) helps drive effective change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.# Growth Frameworks and Strategies

Bengali Kaba, with a distinguished career as an early growth Product Manager (PM) at Facebook, Head of Growth at Instagram, VP of Product at Instacart, and now Director of Product Management at YouTube, has significantly impacted various company cultures through his innovative approaches to growth and product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He has also advised numerous startups, including Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. His insights are particularly valuable for anyone looking to excel in product and [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Core Growth Philosophy

Kaba's philosophy centers on driving impact, which he believes is the most crucial output to optimize for in a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Impact directly influences compensation and career leveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For a product manager, impact means driving clarity about product problems and opportunities, focusing prioritization, and consistently delivering results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Understand Work

Kaba champions a concept known as "Understand Work," a framework adopted and shepherded from his time at Facebook to Instagram, Instacart, Twitter, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

He highlights a common [[common_misconceptions_in_growth_strategies | anti-pattern]] he calls "Identify, Justify, Execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. This occurs when a team decides to build something and then retrospectively pulls data to justify it, often leading to unimpactful outcomes despite significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

Instead, the preferred approach is "Understand, Identify, Execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This means starting with a deep, first-principles understanding of the problem or opportunity before identifying solutions and executing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

Understand work is an intentional part of the execution plan, dedicated to de-risking a project and gathering crucial insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. It's explicitly put on the roadmap, not assumed to happen in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. For example, at Instagram, significant "understand work" was done to define what constitutes a "good connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

Understand work can involve:
*   **Data Science:** Pulling funnels, analyzing different user types, defining proxy metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Engineering:** Instrumenting logging to ensure data visibility, refactoring code for scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Product Management:** Dogfooding products, understanding ecosystems, defining partnership strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **User Research:** Gathering feedback, insights from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

This approach creates parallel paths of work, where teams execute on high-conviction items while simultaneously conducting understand work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This leads to a "velocity multiplier" over time, increasing clarity and the win rate of shipped products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. At Instagram, this strategy led to 60-70% of experiments being positive and shippable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

> [!Note] Slow Down to Speed Up
> This method suggests slowing down to speed up, leading to more intelligent execution rather than just faster shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. It's about optimizing for long-term gains through a series of short-term, intelligent executions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

### Growth Flywheels

Kaba emphasizes the importance of identifying and nurturing [[effective_growth_frameworks | growth flywheels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. This involves understanding the value proposition at every point of the user experience, especially in a [[marketplace_growth_strategies | multi-sided marketplace]] like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. The goal is to connect the dots in a compelling story that provides clarity and purpose for the teams on what to work on, and what not to work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Adjacent User Theory

A key aspect of Kaba's [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth strategy]], developed at Instagram, is the "Adjacent User Theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. In a hypergrowth product, the user base changes rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The theory suggests understanding:
1.  **Current Users:** Who they are, what motivates them, and why they use the product today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.
2.  **Next Users:** Identifying who could be using the product but isn't, and understanding their unmet needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

This means actively "dogfooding" the product from the perspective of an adjacent user – perhaps by creating a new account or using it in a way a less tech-savvy person might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This helps reveal "obvious opportunities missed" that power users might overlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This theory is mandatory for hypergrowth companies and very helpful for companies seeking to capture more market share by understanding why non-customers aren't buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Real-world Examples of Growth Strategies

### Instagram Growth Loops

Instagram's rapid growth was not solely due to virality. It involved a combination of compounding [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth loops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

*   **Celebrity Partnerships:** A critical, often unspoken, growth funnel was the partnership team working with celebrities, teaching them how to use Instagram to tell their stories and build their brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This strategy was in place even before Kaba joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.
*   **SEO & Embeds:** Celebrity content, picked up by news and media outlets, linked back to Instagram profiles and posts, creating a powerful Search Engine Optimization (SEO) engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. The launch of Instagram's web presence was crucial for SEO and international growth, increasing growth by 10% immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>. Embeds of Instagram content on other sites further boosted SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
*   **Paid Media:** This layered on top of the organic signals, further supercharging the user acquisition engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

These different [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth engines]] compounded each other, magnifying top-of-funnel acquisition while ensuring mid-funnel retention and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.

### Instagram Account Access and Connections Pivot

At Instagram, Kaba's team addressed a significant problem where hundreds of thousands of people daily couldn't log back into their accounts after logging out, especially in regions like South Asia and Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>. This was because users shared phones, used prepaid plans (requiring logout to save background data), or simply forgot complex login details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.

The solutions included:
*   **Omni Box Login:** Combining email, phone number, and handle into a single, simple login field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.
*   **Trusted Device Text Message:** Sending a text message verification after two failed login attempts on a trusted device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.
*   **Save Credentials / Passcode:** Prompting users to save login credentials or set up a passcode upon logout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.

These changes led to a gain of 15-20 million additional monthly active users per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. Critically, this "understand work" also revealed an unexpected insight: solving account access issues led to more content creation, particularly from users accessing second and third accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>. This realization led to the creation of a "multiple accounts" team, which developed the seamless account switching features seen on Instagram today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.

Another pivotal shift at Instagram was the "connections pivot" around 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. Initially, the platform's machine learning optimized for any follow, treating celebrity follows and friend follows equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. However, data showed that while users quickly followed celebrities, their retention would dip after several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>. This was because when new users made their first post, none of their *friends* were following them, leading to a feeling of "posting in an echo chamber" and ultimately churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. The team successfully argued to prioritize "regular human connections" in the first few days of sign-up, ensuring users felt validated and part of a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. This single shift literally doubled Instagram's retention over 1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.

### Instacart Reordering

At Instacart, Kaba observed that despite people often buying the same groceries repeatedly, the app made reordering difficult, requiring many clicks to find previous items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. Data showed that after five orders, 90% of a user's basket was the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. By simplifying the reordering process (e.g., allowing users to select individual items from past orders rather than reordering the whole thing), Instacart could significantly improve retention and drive [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This highlights focusing on the "job to be done" – people want to easily assemble a meal, not just buy individual ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### Facebook People Recommendations in India

As a growth PM for people recommendations at Facebook, Kaba noticed that the platform's people graph in India seemed "broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>. Users had fewer friends in common (e.g., 7 in India vs. 22 in the US) and exhibited high friending/unfriending behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>.

Through on-the-ground "understand work" in India, observing users directly, Kaba learned that Facebook's Western-centric profile fields (like school, job title) were irrelevant for many Indian users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. Common names like "Amit Kumar" further complicated identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. Users often resorted to looking at photos to identify connections, as this was the only relevant information available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This demonstrated that the existing design, based on Western paradigms, did not support the "job to be done" of finding friends in this cultural context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The team had to find creative, culturally sensitive ways to enable connections.

## Common Growth Opportunities

Based on his experience, Kaba finds that most [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth opportunities]] often lie in the **onboarding to habit-building experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. Many teams fail to understand the user's first "aha moment" and how to foster habit formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. While top-of-funnel acquisition is crucial, without strong retention and habit building, a product will merely be a "leaky bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. The goal is to build compounding [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth loops]] (two, three, or four different ways of acquiring users) that layer onto each other and supercharge the engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

## Managing Complex Change

Kaba utilizes a [[product_management_career_growth_framework | framework]] for "Managing Complex Change" when aiming to improve or change team cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. This framework identifies five essential components for successful change:
1.  **Vision:** A clear understanding of the desired future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. (Missing Vision leads to Confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>)
2.  **Skills:** The capabilities required to achieve the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. (Missing Skills leads to Anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>)
3.  **Incentives:** Motivation for individuals and teams to align with the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. (Missing Incentives leads to Resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>)
4.  **Resources:** The necessary tools, budget, and personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. (Missing Resources leads to Frustration)
5.  **Action Plan:** A clear roadmap for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. (Missing Action Plan leads to False Starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>)

When encountering a struggling team, Kaba observes the "symptoms" (confusion, frustration, anxiety, resistance, false starts) to identify which component is missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. Addressing these specific gaps with targeted interventions (e.g., providing a product craft framework for skills, or improving team meeting structures for action plans) helps drive effective change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
