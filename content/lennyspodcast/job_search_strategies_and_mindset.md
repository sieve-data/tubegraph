Looking for a job effectively requires a focused approach, similar to how a product person thinks about product market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Instead of a broad "net," job seekers need a "spear" with a narrow, clear focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Importance of [[Building support networks Job search councils | Job Search Councils]]

Job Search Councils (JSCs) are support groups consisting of six to eight job seekers who commit to supporting each other through the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:39">[02:57:39]</a>. These councils originated from the product community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:22">[03:04:22]</a>.

> [!info] Job Search Council Structure
> Over 2,000 JSCs have been launched, and they are completely free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:20">[09:15:20]</a>. They are volunteer-driven, with over 20,000 hours of volunteer work invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:34">[09:37:34]</a>. Phil Terry, author of "Never Search Alone," funds the councils with his book sales, dedicating twice the amount of sales back into running them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06">[09:56:06]</a>.
>
> To join, individuals apply at phil.org <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:39">[10:31:39]</a> and are matched into groups based on their employment status:
> *   **Slow Seekers:** Those currently employed and looking for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:19">[10:52:19]</a>. They typically meet every two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:58">[12:15:58]</a>.
> *   **Fast Seekers:** Those who are out of work and actively searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:13">[10:57:13]</a>. They typically meet twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:47">[12:12:47]</a>.
>
> Every council needs a moderator, who is also a job seeker and receives more training and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:54">[11:03:54]</a>. After matching, members go through a live orientation program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:47">[11:31:47]</a> and receive a free 100-page workbook with templates and guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:27">[11:46:27]</a>. The first meeting, "meeting zero," focuses on building trust through sharing personal stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:04">[12:01:04]</a>. Members stay in the council until they find a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:09">[12:23:09]</a>.

> [!tip] The "Never Search Alone" Philosophy
> JSCs address the common feeling of insecurity and anxiety in the job search, which is experienced by everyone, including senior leaders like CEOs and CPOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:06">[03:47:06]</a>. Doing it alone magnifies this insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:21">[03:52:21]</a>. Putting anxious people together, encouraging openness, vulnerability, and asking for help, transforms fear into hope, motivation, accountability, and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:14">[04:14:14]</a>.

> The method was developed through Phil's personal experience, starting with his mother's teacher's council in 1960, which met for 50 years to support each other's [[Career advancement strategies | careers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:06">[05:15:06]</a>. It proved effective even in tough job markets, such as when his mother, a single middle-aged woman with kids, struggled to find a job in the mid-70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:54">[06:06:54]</a>. The method also emerged during the dot-com bubble burst when Phil helped hundreds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:07">[06:27:07]</a>.
>
> JSCs act as a "private safety net" for those who have been laid off, providing tools and community to navigate the job market where government programs cannot innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:10">[01:54:10]</a>.

## Understanding [[Candidate market fit and job targeting | Candidate Market Fit]]

[[Candidate market fit and job targeting | Candidate Market Fit]] is considered the most important job search tactic, alongside Job Search Councils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. It acknowledges that the job market operates on supply and demand, meaning your fit can change based on market conditions, like a downturn in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. This means a role you might have qualified for previously could be out of reach due to increased competition from more senior candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:19">[02:30:19]</a>. Understanding this market reality can be a relief, as it's "not about you" personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:39">[02:54:39]</a>.

### The Manukan Two-Pager and Listening Tour
The first radical step is to define "what you want and what you don't want" in a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>. This is encapsulated in the "Manukan two-pager" (named after Allison Manukan, a product council member), which helps job seekers articulate their preferences before "spray and pray" job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>. This initial draft is shared with the Job Search Council for feedback, as others can help you refine your desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>.

Once you have a draft, embark on a "listening tour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>. This involves speaking with:
*   **Former colleagues (reverse exit interviews):** Ask about your strengths and what roles they think you'd be a good fit for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:54">[02:17:54]</a>.
*   **Broader network:** Ask the "golden question": "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:54">[02:17:54]</a>.
*   **Recruiters:** Recruiters prefer specific questions about your fit rather than general "get me a job" requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>. Build relationships with recruiters even when employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.

The listening tour provides market research and customer feedback on your fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:06">[03:22:06]</a>. It also helps build a network of "listening posts"—people invested in your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:43">[03:29:43]</a>.

### Crafting a Focused Candidate Market Fit Statement
After the listening tour, create a narrow, clear [[Candidate market fit and job targeting | Candidate Market Fit]] statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:58">[03:13:58]</a>. This is analogous to product market fit, where a broad focus doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. You need a "spear, not a net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>.

A good CMF statement typically has three to four attributes, such as:
*   **Role/Level:** Director of Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>
*   **Industry:** Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>
*   **Company Stage:** Series B startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>
*   **Location:** San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>
*   **Specific Need:** Companies without a design team or needing to reboot one (for a product designer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:53">[03:39:53]</a>.

People tend to resist narrowing their focus, but a narrow statement allows others to be expansive on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a>. If you say you'll take "any product job," people won't remember you; if you're specific, they can connect you to related opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Adapting to Market Conditions
> Your CMF must be adaptive. In a down market, you might need to adjust your target role (e.g., a Director of Product might need to aim for a Senior Manager role due to VPs seeking Director roles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:19">[02:30:19]</a>. This is not a personal failing but a market reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:26">[02:44:26]</a>. Sometimes, a "two-step strategy" is necessary, accepting a lower-level or different role to gain experience closer to the "technology frontier" for long-term [[Building a longterm career strategy | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:16">[03:52:16]</a>. Being close to the technology frontier increases new job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:39">[03:38:39]</a>.

Once your council signs off on your CMF, share it with your network and post it on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:09">[03:42:09]</a>.

## [[Effective negotiation tactics for job offers | Playing to Win]] in Interviews and Negotiations

Many job seekers make the mistake of not being in charge during the interview and negotiation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. The mindset should be "play to win, not to lose," which means being proactive and collaborative, not ruthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

### The Job Mission with OKRs
Before interviewing, create your own "job mission with OKRs" (Objectives and Key Results) for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.
1.  **Draft privately:** This helps you understand the job and formulate clarifying questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.
2.  **Share with hiring manager:** After a couple of interviews, share your draft job mission with OKRs with the hiring manager (preferably live, not via email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. This demonstrates initiative, accountability, and a focus on outcomes, making you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. Companies are impressed when a candidate thinks about the role better than they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
3.  **Clarify the role:** This conversation helps clarify if the job is truly what you expect, avoiding situations where "job A turns out to be job B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.

### Negotiating for Success
The job mission with OKRs also sets the stage for a collaborative negotiation, focused on "the four legs of the negotiation stool" – the resources needed for your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. Instead of just discussing salary, express what you believe is needed to achieve the agreed-upon OKRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.

Examples of things to negotiate (beyond salary):
*   Budget for technical debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>
*   Team training or development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>
*   Hiring additional staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>
*   Mentorship or professional development opportunities (for junior roles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>

This approach shows the company you're thinking about success and commitment, which benefits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. If they refuse necessary resources, you go into the job with "eyes wide open" about the constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

Regarding salary, 87% of the time, asking for more money results in a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. Frame your request collaboratively, e.g., "Are you open to [higher number]? That's what I was hoping for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

## The Art of Asking for Help

Asking for help is a critical skill for career advancement and job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

> [!tip] Counterintuitive Rules of Asking for Help
> 1.  **Not a sign of weakness:** It's a sign of confidence that both requires and strengthens it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
> 2.  **A giving activity:** When done well, it allows the person you're asking to feel valued and honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. People love giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.
> 3.  **Leads to independence:** It helps you become more self-sufficient and accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.
> 4.  **Improves reputation:** It shows thoughtfulness and initiative, enhancing how others perceive you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.

> [!tip] How to Ask for Help Effectively
> *   **Do your homework:** Don't ask someone to do the work for you; seek advice, perspective, and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
> *   **Be open and vulnerable:** Share your struggles and be honest about what you're asking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.
> *   **Consider the relationship:** Tailor your request to your relationship with the person; don't make cold, demanding asks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.
> *   **Use emotional intelligence:** Be mindful of who you're asking and if you trust them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.
> *   **Focus on learning:** Phrases like "I'd love your perspective and thoughts" or "How would you approach it?" are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.
> *   **Debrief after interviews:** Talk through what happened in an interview to get an objective perspective and combat inner critic thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.

Examples of asking for help in action:
*   **Defining reality:** A CEO constantly asking others, "How do you see things? What do you see?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>.
*   **Peer coaching calls:** Convening other professionals in similar roles to get advice on specific challenges (e.g., platforming a digital retail business, first 90 days in a new role, [[navigating_career_transitions_and_promotions | career evolution]] to a VP role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.
*   **Informal check-ins:** A director at Google checking with Sundar Pichai (now CEO) if a meeting was as intense for him too, building trust and a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

## Job Search Mindset and Emotional Balance

The job search process can be hard and humiliating, and it's easy to feel demoralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. The most important thing to manage during a job search is your "emotional balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

> [!info] Key Mindset Principles
> *   **Everyone feels insecure:** No matter who you are, everyone experiences anxiety and insecurity in the job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>. You are not alone and there's nothing wrong with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
> *   **Combat loneliness:** Job search councils help counteract the increasing loneliness in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>.
> *   **Embrace the "I in Village":** While there's "no I in team," there is an "I in village" – meaning you must be independent, accountable, and responsible for your search, even when asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.
> *   **Stay active and updated:** Don't get passive. Continuously network, update your [[Candidate market fit and job targeting | Candidate Market Fit]], and send monthly updates to your network, even if there's no major news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.
> *   **Cultivate gratitude:** The "Gratitude House" exercise (reflecting on everyone who has helped you) helps build confidence and reminds you that you're not alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>.
> *   **Manage your inner critic:** Give your inner critic a name to externalize and recognize its lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.
> *   **Invest in yourself:** If you've been out of work for a while and feel worthless, remember you are not worthless. Invest your time and energy in proven strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.

Beyond the "Never Search Alone" Job Search Councils, Phil Terry also runs:
*   **Product Councils:** Paid programs for VPs and CPOs, offering a private, safe environment for leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:18">[01:32:18]</a>.
*   **Associate Council Program:** For individual contributors and new managers, with a focus on women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:41">[01:32:41]</a>.
*   **CEO and UX Groups:** Specialized councils for these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:28">[01:32:28]</a>.
*   **Reading Odyssey:** A partnership with Harvard and Cambridge for lifelong learning and curiosity, encouraging more reading among product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:14">[01:34:14]</a>.
*   **World Business Reading Group:** A pro bono high school business literacy program based on the philosophy of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>.
*   **Slow Art Day:** An initiative in 1,500 museums globally that teaches people to slow down and look at art, fostering visual literacy, empathy, and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:13">[01:37:13]</a>.

> [!tip] Cultivating Mentors through Reading
> Most people, even senior leaders, do not have mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. You can gain "dead or distant mentors" by deeply studying historical figures or successful individuals (e.g., Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>. Books are "machines to think with," and rereading important books helps deeply inform decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.
