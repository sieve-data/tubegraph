## Overview

Over the past 25 years, [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] has experienced significant economic and political turbulence, leading to its status as an international pariah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Initially under the leadership of [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Hugo Chavez]] and later accelerating under Nicolas Maduro, the country transitioned from being one of South America's wealthiest and most democratic states to an impoverished, authoritarian, and isolated nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] currently appears to be regaining international acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Geographic and Demographic Context

The Bolivarian Republic of [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] is located in the northern part of South America, with its north coast bordered by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. To its east lies Guyana, to its south Brazil, and to its west Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. With an area of approximately 920,000 square kilometers (350,000 square miles), it ranks as the 32nd largest member of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Its current population is around 29 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Colonial History and Independence

The modern origins of [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] trace back to 1499 when Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci landed in the area, naming it "Little Venice" due to the native stilt houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. By the mid-16th century, Spain had colonized the region, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of Peru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. In the 18th century, it became part of the new Viceroyalty of Granada, alongside present-day Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] later gained a distinct political identity as a captaincy general within the viceroyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The movement for independence intensified at the beginning of the 19th century amidst the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, which weakened Spain's hold on its empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Under the leadership of Simon Bolivar, the Viceroyalty of Granada became the Republic of Colombia in 1821 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Less than a decade later, [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] and Ecuador became independent states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Post-Independence and The Resource Curse

Almost immediately after independence, [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] fell into factionalism and experienced a succession of military dictatorships, struggling under poor administration and increasing indebtedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Impact of Oil Wealth

Everything changed at the beginning of the 20th century with the discovery of oil in the west of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Over the subsequent decades, [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] significantly benefited from the global surge in demand for fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. By the 1950s, it had emerged as the world's largest petroleum exporter, serving as a key supplier to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This oil wealth drove economic development in various other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. In contrast to many of its neighbors, [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] also transitioned from military rule to democratic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Economic Challenges and Political Instability

Serious economic problems emerged in the late 1980s when international oil prices fell dramatically between 1981 and 1986, leading to a debt crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. As inflation surged and unemployment grew, the country descended into political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. In 1989, major riots in Caracas resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths as security forces fired on protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Hugo Chavez]] Era

In 1992, [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Hugo Chavez]], a young left-wing military officer, launched an unsuccessful coup against the government, leading to his imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Pardoned a couple of years later, Chavez founded the Fifth Republic Movement political party and won the country's presidential election in 1998 with 56% of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

Once in power, [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Chavez]] initiated a radical agenda of economic, social, and political change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Buoyed by renewed oil price rises, he increased public spending on healthcare and education and launched ambitious public infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. He nationalized parts of the economy and appointed inexperienced political allies to key sectors, including the oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. While his popularity grew among the poor, this led to increasing opposition from the middle classes and the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

In April 2002, [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Chavez]] was briefly forced from power by a military coup, but his supporters quickly mobilized, leading to the collapse of the uprising and his return within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Undaunted, he continued his radical domestic agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

On the international stage, [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Chavez]] became a high-profile, outspoken voice for the developing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. He openly criticized the United States, accusing it of being behind the attempt to overthrow him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. As tensions grew between Washington and Moscow, [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Chavez]] strengthened relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Despite high international oil prices, [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]]'s poorly run oil industry suffered from low investment and poor maintenance, leading to declining production and slowing revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Nicolas Maduro's Presidency and International Isolation

In March 2013, [[hugo_chavezs_presidency_and_policies | Chavez]] died and was immediately succeeded by then-Vice President Nicolas Maduro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Maduro, committed to his predecessor's policies, narrowly won a special presidential election a month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The following year, [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]]'s economic difficulties escalated into a full-blown crisis as global oil prices sharply dropped, falling from nearly $110 a barrel in June 2014 to just $29 a barrel by January 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This collapse devastated the economy and living standards, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, and popular protests erupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

In an effort to maintain power, Maduro clamped down on civil liberties and democratic freedoms, introducing rule by decree and imposing media restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. As protests grew, he appeared to authorize the use of lethal force against demonstrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

International concern mounted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Despite [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]] remaining one of the largest oil suppliers to the United States, Washington began to impose sanctions on the regime for its human rights violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The European Union also began imposing targeted sanctions in November 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment occurred in May 2018 with new presidential elections, which were widely condemned as neither free nor fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Maduro claimed an overwhelming victory and was sworn into office for a second term on January 10, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. However, the result was widely rejected by the two defeated candidates and the National Assembly, then under opposition control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The Assembly named its President, Juan Guaidó, as the country's interim president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

International opinion became deeply divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Many countries, including Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, [[ethiopian_political_history_and_conflicts | Ethiopia]], and South Africa, accepted Maduro as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. In contrast, the West—including the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, and Japan—chose to recognize Guaidó as interim president, as did many South American states like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Amidst widespread protests and over a million Venezuelans having fled the economic collapse, the matter was brought before the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Although no action was taken due to divisions among permanent members, many countries, notably the United States, openly began calling Maduro a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Shifting International Acceptance

Despite this backdrop, [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]]'s international standing appears to be shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. In November 2022, Nicolas Maduro attended the COP27 environment summit in Egypt, where he had a highly public conversation with French President Macron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. France, which had previously refused to recognize Maduro, saw Macron refer to him as president in an exceptionally friendly exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. There are also signs that other countries, including the United States, may be changing their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

This shift has been a steady process over the past year or so; for instance, the EU ceased recognizing Guaidó as interim president in January 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The apparent change in approach is driven by two main factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>:

1.  **Political Changes in South America**: The election of Gustavo Petro in neighboring Colombia has led to a significant thawing of relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. On November 1, Petro became the first Latin American leader to visit Maduro since the 2019 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The rise of the political left elsewhere in the region, such as Luis Inácio Lula de Silva winning recent elections in Brazil, may also influence engagement with Maduro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
2.  **Pragmatism and Realism in the West**: Hopes that Maduro would be swiftly removed from power due to the disastrous economic situation have not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Wider geopolitical factors have altered previous calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. [[potential_geopolitical_consequences_of_a_venezuelan_invasion | Russia's war against Ukraine]] has disrupted energy supplies, forcing a global search for other oil producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. [[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]], possessing the world's largest oil reserves, could not be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Maduro's regime, despite its brutal and authoritarian nature, has benefited from this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

[[venezuelas_changing_international_status | Venezuela]]'s current "rehabilitation" is not due to overcoming its "resource curse" by re-establishing democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Instead, it is driven by the rest of the world's continued reliance on fossil fuels, which itself is a form of the "resource curse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
