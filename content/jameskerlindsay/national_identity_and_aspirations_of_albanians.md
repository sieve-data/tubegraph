In recent months, there has been renewed discussion about the possibility of [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] uniting with neighboring Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This idea has been openly raised by two former prime ministers of [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While the logic for such a move may seem understandable, it faces significant obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Background to Unification Talk

[[Legal and political arguments regarding Kosovos independence | Kosovo's declaration of independence]] in February 2008 divided [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | international opinion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The United States and most of the European Union recognized its independence, but many countries, including Russia and China, remain opposed to its statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. As a result, [[legal_and_political_arguments_regarding_kosovos_independence | Kosovo]] remains outside the United Nations, and its hopes of joining the European Union are on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Against this backdrop, senior [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovan]] political figures have increasingly discussed the option of uniting with Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Albin Kurti, leader of Vetëvendosje and recent election winner in [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]], supports the idea and stated he would vote for unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Ramush Haradinaj, a former prime minister, indicated that if [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] European integration remains blocked, a referendum on unification might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, this suggestion carries many [[political_and_legal_challenges_to_kosovoalbania_unification | legal and political implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Demographics and Geographic Context

Albania, located in Southeast Europe, spans 29,000 square kilometers, making it the 140th largest of the 193 UN members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Its population is 2.9 million, with the vast majority being ethnic Albanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Greeks are the largest ethnic minority, comprising one to two percent of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

[[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]], at 11,000 square kilometers, is roughly one-third the size of Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Its population is 1.8 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The most recent census indicated that 93% of [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] population is ethnic Albanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, with the remaining seven percent predominantly Serbs, alongside smaller communities of Montenegrins, Bosniaks, and Roma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Both countries have extensive diaspora populations abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Historical Context and Separation of Albanian Territories

The story of Albanian national identity and aspirations for unification dates back to 1913 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Under the Treaties of London and Bucharest, the borders of a new Albanian state were drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. However, these new borders left almost half of the region's Albanians living outside the new Principality of Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The largest concentration of Albanians outside Albania was in the Kingdom of Serbia, which included most of what is now [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] and North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Others were in Montenegro and Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This demarcation led Albanians in Albania and elsewhere to follow very different paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

In 1918, Serbia and Montenegro became part of what would become Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. After World War II, both Albania and Yugoslavia came under communist rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Although initial relations were good, they soon deteriorated, especially after Albania adopted an extreme isolationist regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The collapse of the communist regime in Albania and the disintegration of socialist Yugoslavia in 1991 allowed for greater contact between Albania and Albanian communities across the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. However, political union remained out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

*   **North Macedonia:** In late 1991, Macedonia (now North Macedonia) gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Half a million Albanians, the second-largest Albanian community outside Albania, found themselves in this new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Montenegro:** The small Albanian community in Montenegro also became part of a new state following its independence in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Kosovo:** The most significant development was [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] attempt to break away from Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Following an escalation of fighting, NATO intervened in March 1999, placing [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] under UN administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. After failed UN talks, [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] unilaterally declared independence in February 2008, supported by the US and most of the EU, but opposed by Serbia, Russia, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Since then, over half of the UN members have recognized [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Reasons Behind Current Unification Discussions

Despite [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] being recognized by a significant proportion of the international community, several factors underpin the renewed discussions about unification with Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>:

### National Identity
Many view the unification of all [[historical_context_of_albanian_territories | Albanian territories]] as the national aspiration of the Albanian people, often referred to as 'Natural Albania' or 'Greater Albania' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, some prefer to avoid an overtly expansionist message, focusing instead on closer unity between Albania and [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] as overwhelmingly Albanian countries with a free will to unite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama is a key proponent of this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. In recent years, [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] and Albania have grown closer politically, holding joint cabinet sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Rama has appointed [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovan]] Albanians to senior government positions in Albania and has floated ideas for open borders and even a joint presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, leading to claims of "unification by stealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Practical Realities and International Standing
For others, the idea of unification is driven by practical concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The pace of international recognitions for [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] has slowed dramatically; since 2018, only Israel has recognized it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Simultaneously, some countries have withdrawn their recognitions due to a diplomatic campaign by Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Crucially, [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] path to full international acceptance, particularly UN membership, is blocked by Russia and China, with no signs of a change in their stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This exclusion from parts of the international system suggests that unifying with Albania could indirectly integrate [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] into the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Pressure for EU Integration
Talk of unification also serves as a way to apply pressure on countries to unblock [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] path to EU integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This path is stalled due to opposition from five EU members that do not recognize [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]], coupled with broader concerns about Western Balkan enlargement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Statements by figures like former President Hashim Thaci and former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj explicitly link unification to the EU's failure to offer [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] a clear European perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Public and Political Support for Unification

While there appears to be popular support for unification, a deeper look reveals a mixed picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. A 2010 poll indicated overwhelming support for 'Greater Albania' (including Albania, [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]], and Albanian-inhabited parts of North Macedonia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. However, support for a union solely between [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] and Albania dropped to 34% in Albania and 29% in [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

More recently, a 2019 poll showed higher support for unification at 75% in Albania and 64% in [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Yet, this support significantly dropped to 29% in Albania and 44% in [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] when respondents were asked if they would pay a tax to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

This suggests that while the idea may be popular in principle, practicalities are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Many [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovan]] Albanians fear taking a secondary position if Albania becomes the national heartland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The type of union – unitary, federal, or confederal – would also need to be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Obstacles to Unification

Despite potential political and popular support, unification faces significant hurdles:

### Constitutional Blockages
Article 1 of [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] constitution explicitly outlaws union with another state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While a constitutional amendment is theoretically possible, it would require a two-thirds vote in [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] 120-member parliament, including two-thirds support from the 20 members representing national minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Of these minority members, 10 are ethnic Serbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It is considered highly implausible that any, let alone six, of the Serb deputies, would vote for unification with Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. From this perspective, a union seems impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### International Opposition
Even if the constitutional hurdles were overcome, the international community would strongly oppose unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. For countries that do not recognize [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] independence, such a move would be seen as a violation of Serbia's territorial integrity and unlawful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

For countries that have recognized [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]], the situation is more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. While the democratic will of sovereign states should typically prevail if a union is pursued legally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, the wider context of the Western Balkans is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

There is a significant fear that unification would trigger a chain reaction across the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>:
*   **North Macedonia:** If [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] and Albania unite, there would likely be pressure for unification from Albanians in North Macedonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This is linked to the [[historical_and_cultural_identity_issues_between_bulgaria_and_north_macedonia | historical and cultural identity issues]] in the region and the [[impact_of_yugoslavia_on_macedonian_identity | impact of Yugoslavia]] on national identities.
*   **Serbs in the Region:** If Albanians are seen to have the right to unite, it could lead to similar calls from Serbs in the region, posing a challenge to [[nationalism_and_secessionist_threats_in_bosnia | Bosnia]] and Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **International Redrawing of Borders:** Countries that supported [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] independence did so on the explicit understanding that there would be no further redrawing of borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Any attempt at unification would lead to immense pressure from the United States and the European Union on Pristina and Tirana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

Talk of unification between [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] and Albania has attracted significant [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | international attention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. However, it seems highly unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Beyond the constitutional blockages, it would face fierce opposition from both states that do not recognize [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] independence and those that do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Such discussions are more likely a strategy to encourage greater [[international_relations_and_national_identity_in_the_balkans | international engagement]] to resolve the deadlock over [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo's]] international standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, rather than a genuine attempt to abandon its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Nevertheless, the longer [[possible_unification_of_kosovo_and_albania | Kosovo]] remains in limbo, the louder these calls for unification may become, tempting politicians despite the potential consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
