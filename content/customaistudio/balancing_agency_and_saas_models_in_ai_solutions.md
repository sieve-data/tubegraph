The journey of Custom AI Studio illustrates a unique approach to balancing the agency and Software as a Service (SaaS) models in the emerging AI market. Starting with an ambition to build a SaaS, the company quickly pivoted to an agency model due to market realities, eventually attracting strategic investment.

## Initial SaaS Ambition and Challenges

Initially, the goal was to build a SaaS product, recognized as "the big play" for securing the best multiples and valuations from investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50">[03:50]</a>. However, the team, lacking technical expertise, initially partnered with external development firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a>. They attempted several SaaS products, including:
*   A research report writing agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45">[04:45]</a>.
*   A semantic search tool for retrieving documents (e.g., healthcare records, legal documents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15">[05:15]</a>.
*   A chatbot for interacting with 10K SEC filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41">[05:41]</a>.

These attempts faced significant challenges:
*   **High Upfront Capital**: Building a SaaS product and gaining market share requires substantial upfront capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16">[06:16]</a>. Startups often operate "in the red" for years to build a Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28">[06:28]</a>.
*   **Rapid Market Evolution**: The rapidly evolving AI landscape, with continuous improvements from major players like OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), and Google (Gemini), posed a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50">[06:50]</a>. New features from these companies could quickly render a newly built SaaS product obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02">[07:02]</a>.
*   **Market Share Risk**: Investing time and money into a SaaS product in such an [[Challenges of building a SaaS in the emerging AI market | emerging space]] was deemed too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21">[07:21]</a>.

This led to the realization that building an actual SaaS product followed the same principles as always, requiring immense upfront capital and market share acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16">[06:16]</a>. This context highlights the [[Historical context and evolution of SaaS models | historical context of SaaS models]] applied to a new, volatile market.

## Transition to an Agency Model

Faced with the high risks of a pure SaaS model, the company shifted to an agency model offering broad AI solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33">[07:33]</a>. This pivot was driven by several strategic advantages:
*   **Generate Cash Flow**: An agency model allowed for immediate revenue generation, enabling reinvestment and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28">[11:28]</a>.
*   **Increase "Reps" and Skill Development**: By working on diverse projects, the team could gain practical experience in building systems, learning how to prompt Large Language Models (LLMs), and improving week by week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30">[11:30]</a>.
*   **Free Work for Case Studies**: Offering free work to past clients and college contacts allowed them to complete four to five projects, build case studies, and subsequently leverage these into paid AI work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">[08:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on [[Business application and integration of AI agents | AI Agents]]**: Through experimentation with various tools (e.g., Relevance AI, Mind Studio, Zapier, Voiceflow), they narrowed their focus to [[Understanding and implementing AI agents in businesses | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56">[08:56]</a>. They recognized the potential for LLMs to "traverse the digital space" using APIs, indicating that [[Designing and integrating AI agent teams to automate business functions | agentic workflows]] would be the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19">[09:19]</a>.
*   **Market Pulse and ROI**: Working on over three dozen projects across various industries provided a unique pulse on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14">[12:14]</a>. This allowed them to understand genuine use cases, clients' understanding of AI, and their desired Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27">[12:27]</a>. The focus shifted from technology for its own sake to technology delivering tangible business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41">[12:41]</a>.
*   **Addressing [[Challenges in AI agent integration | Challenges in AI agent integration]]**: The market was seeing an "explosion of development tools" around AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16">[13:16]</a>, but many startups pivoted to building tools when they found it difficult to create last-mile applications that provided direct value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50">[13:50]</a>. The agency model allowed them to stay focused on practical application.
*   **Building Traction**: Openly sharing their work, including a viral YouTube video (18 months of building AI agents in 42 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16">[15:16]</a>, significantly increased cash flow and led to 26 immediate projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26">[15:26]</a>.

## Growth and Funding Decisions

After reaching a natural growth limit, the company faced a choice: build a lifestyle business or "go big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35">[15:35]</a>. Deciding to go big necessitated seeking external funding to scale the team, move up-market, and build more complex solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11">[16:11]</a>.

Funding options considered included strategic investors, angels, VCs, private equity, friends and family, crypto tokens, and continued bootstrapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12">[17:12]</a>. The crypto token model, while offering a way to avoid equity dilution, presented volatility due to constant market pressure for updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23">[18:23]</a>.

Ultimately, they chose a strategic investor over traditional Venture Capital (VC) firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54">[19:54]</a>. The rationale for this decision included:
*   **Accessibility and Support**: The ability to meet easily in person (investors in Austin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57">[18:57]</a>.
*   **Guidance and Resources**: As novices with many "blind spots," they needed a partner they could lean on for advice and resources, especially given the strategic partner's experience in similar businesses and with overseas talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07">[19:07]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: Unlike VCs, who often push for a specific SaaS niche, the strategic partner understood the need for a "discovery phase" and greater flexibility in their agency model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00">[20:00]</a>.

### Investor Perspective

The experience revealed that investors in the AI space often want to get involved but prefer to "Outsource that effort" of keeping up with technology and building systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16">[21:16]</a>. They seek an "operator" – someone obsessed with the space, focused, and capable of building and growing a business regardless of funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54">[20:54]</a>. Investors are not necessarily looking for a "wow factor" idea but rather a reliable "engine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16">[21:16]</a>. The founders themselves, their traction, and their obsession became the "horse to bet on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25">[22:25]</a>.

Key "intangibles" that appealed to investors included:
*   **Focus and Obsession**: Demonstrating unwavering commitment to the AI space and their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21">[23:21]</a>.
*   **Operator Mentality**: Showing the ability to get things done, focusing on systems, operations, efficiency, and frugality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37">[23:37]</a>.
*   **Northstar Vision**: Having a clear flag planted on a mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38">[23:38]</a>.
*   **Team Building**: The ability to attract talented individuals even before significant investment signaled strong potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41">[23:41]</a>.
*   **Business Acumen**: Understanding how to grow a business, manage finances, and worry about numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24">[24:24]</a>.
*   **Confidence and Clarity**: Crucial for resisting external suggestions and maintaining a clear vision, even when facing opposing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27">[25:27]</a>.

### Capitalizing on Momentum

The company leveraged a single viral video into significant momentum, attracting investment interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00">[27:00]</a>. They recognized that this attention was temporary in the rapidly moving AI market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26">[28:26]</a>. The decision to take funding quickly, even if it meant giving up more equity, was driven by the need for speed to build infrastructure and scale before the "Founders Market" for AI investment ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:53">[28:53]</a>.

A core philosophy was to be "stubborn on your vision but very flexible on the details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17">[31:17]</a>. The ultimate goal and impact were prioritized over immediate payout or granular negotiation terms, especially at the early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30">[31:30]</a>. The "fuel" (funding) was essential to "grow the pie" significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03">[32:03]</a>.

### Process for Attracting Investment

The high-level process involved:
1.  **Identify Market Approach**: Focusing on [[Understanding and implementing AI agents in businesses | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:59">[32:59]</a>.
2.  **Find Lighthouse Customers/Clients**: Doing free or cheap work to gain initial projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03">[33:03]</a>.
3.  **Create Proof of Value**: Demonstrating tangible results to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13">[33:13]</a>.
4.  **Build Traction**: Using platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube to showcase projects and build a catalog of case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:26">[33:26]</a>.
5.  **Develop Unique Perspective**: Planting a flag on their mission and having a clear "take" on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36">[33:36]</a>.
6.  **Share Openly**: Leveraging their unique perspective and traction to attract inbound interest from investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49">[33:49]</a>.
7.  **Create a Market for Investment**: Generating competitive interest from multiple potential investors to gain leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:21">[35:21]</a>.
8.  **Define Needs Clearly**: Knowing exactly how much money was needed and what it would go towards, rather than waiting for offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22">[36:22]</a>.
9.  **Ensure Intangibles**: Demonstrating the key qualities like focus, clarity, and team-building ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:49">[36:49]</a>.
10. **Don't Get Caught Up in Details**: Prioritizing speed of closing a deal over prolonged negotiations, especially given the dynamic nature of the AI investment landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55">[36:55]</a>.

## Current Business Model

Currently, Custom AI Studio operates as an agency specializing in [[Business application and integration of AI agents | custom AI agent solutions]] for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19">[39:19]</a>. While they have built many projects and identified common patterns (data, tooling, prompting), they aim to productize their service concept, "Agentagous," rather than immediately launching a fixed SaaS platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01">[39:01]</a>. This allows them to work with clients across various industries and departments, building "agentic operating systems" and refining their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32">[39:32]</a>.

The challenge remains in clearly communicating their value proposition, especially to non-technical business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00">[41:00]</a>. The visual representation of complex node maps (e.g., n8n) can be intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37">[44:37]</a>. The focus is shifting back to articulating the business benefits—such as saving time and providing ROI—rather than technical details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:30">[46:30]</a>.

Future plans include standardizing their development process to enable niche-specific satellite websites and leveraging channel partners to sell their productized services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07">[50:07]</a>. They also use pricing to filter out leads that don't have the necessary budget, as they experienced an overwhelming volume of calls from individuals seeking free information or low-cost solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50">[52:50]</a>. This highlights the challenge of managing the "missing middle" of sales—projects that are too complex for small-scale solutions but not yet large enough for enterprise sales cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51">[54:51]</a>.

The strategic investor also acts as an R&D arm, passing on clients seeking agent-building services and exploring the vertical agent idea to invest in entrepreneurs for product spin-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:09">[56:09]</a>. This hybrid model allows for both service delivery and potential product development.
