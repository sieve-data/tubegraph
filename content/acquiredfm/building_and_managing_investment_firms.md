This article explores the complexities of building and managing investment firms, drawing insights from legendary value investor Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, and his son Andrew Marks, co-founder of TQ Ventures. It delves into their differing [[investment_philosophies_and_business_strategies | investment philosophies]], the [[the_evolution_of_investment_strategies | evolution of investment strategies]], and the unique challenges of firm architecture in dynamic markets.

## Howard and Andrew Marks: A Generational Debate
The episode features Howard Marks and his son Andrew Marks, representing two distinct [[investment_philosophies_and_business_strategies | investment styles]]: Howard as a value investor and Andrew as a growth-oriented tech investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Oaktree Capital Management, co-founded by Howard, is a leading investment management firm specializing in alternative investments with $159 billion in assets under management as of June 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. TQ Ventures, co-founded by Andrew, is an early-stage venture firm that has accumulated $1 billion under management in just five years, achieving top decile returns across venture funds raised in that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>.

Their collaboration on the memo "Something of Value" became Howard's most popular memo ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This memo emerged from their family discussions during the COVID-19 pandemic, debating value investing versus growth investing and the state of tech markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Strategies
Andrew Marks' personal [[the_evolution_of_investment_strategies | investment trajectory]] evolved from starting as a value investor, influenced by his father and Warren Buffett, to focusing on growth companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. He learned to consider how to reinvest cash flows at high rates, extending beyond just maintenance cash flow to include investments in high-return sales, talented engineering teams, and R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

### Amazon as a Case Study
Amazon is highlighted as a prime example of a company where betting on an amazing founder, rather than just current fundamentals, proved crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. Its ability to leverage its business to create value in compelling other ways (e.g., AWS emerging from a retail focus) demonstrates the importance of recognizing "optionality" in a management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. Early perceptions that Amazon was a "charity run for the benefit of the American consumer" by looking solely at the income statement missed its favorable cash conversion cycle and sound free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.

### The "Too Hard Pile" and Predictability
Howard Marks, primarily a credit investor, historically avoided tech companies due to their unpredictability, often putting them on the "too hard pile" as Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. His career shifted to distressed debt and high-yield bonds in the late 1970s at [[investment_strategies_at_citibank | Citibank]], a field that was largely avoided by others, demonstrating the value of open-mindedness and going against the consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.

> "When you go to an auction and you sit down, take your seat and you see there are no other bidders, that's usually a good thing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>

The prevailing prejudice against low-rated bonds, often defined as "failing to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment," created significant opportunities because they were mispriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. Howard likened this to life insurance companies making money knowing everyone will die, by understanding and pricing risk, diversifying, and being well-paid for taking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.

### The "Nifty 50" and Disruption
In contrast to high-yield bonds, Howard's early experience at [[investment_strategies_at_citibank | Citibank]] involved the "Nifty 50," a group of "best and fastest-growing companies" considered so good that "nothing bad could ever happen" and "there was no price too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>. Many of these companies, like IBM and Xerox, were priced too high or suffered from disruption, leading to significant losses for investors who held them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>. This illustrates that "both stances are wrong" – neither there is "no price too high" nor "no price low enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:28]</a>.

The traditional "moats" of industries, like newspapers, were considered inviolate but were eventually disrupted by technological change and shifting consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>. The world today is characterized by accelerating technological adoption and rapid change, making traditional business durability less certain and requiring continuous evolution from management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.

### Complexity Investing Principles
The changing landscape means that companies are now more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. While the future is more uncertain and moats are less permanent, the potential for value creation is higher for companies that can leverage advantages, enter adjacent markets, and launch new products globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>. This concept, dubbed "increasing returns in the new world of business" by Brian Arthur, explains how companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft continue to dominate and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

## Market Efficiency and Competitive Advantage
In today's markets, "readily available quantitative information about the present" is no longer a source of competitive advantage due to its ubiquity and the efforts of countless smart people, algorithms, and machine learning systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>. Investing has become a "zero-sum game" where success requires a knowledge or skill advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.

This necessitates:
*   **Qualitative Judgments about the Future**: Going beyond superficial analysis of financials to understand a company's prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing**: Understanding to what extent future prospects are already reflected in the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:00">[36:50:00]</a>.

## Venture Investing at TQ Ventures
Andrew Marks' shift to early-stage private market investing with TQ Ventures is driven by his [[finding_the_right_investment_strategy_for_individual_skill_sets | personal skill set]], which is better suited to:
*   Making long-term, qualitative judgments about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>.
*   Finding "huge gaps between what you're paying today and what this could be worth if it's right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:22]</a>.
*   Engaging in a probabilistic endeavor, where the average outcome is losing money but enough successful bets lead to great returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>.

Unlike Howard's focus on avoiding permanent capital loss, venture capital is about finding extremely high expected value investments, where the focus is on a portfolio of risky bets rather than individual low-risk investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:26:00">[39:26:00]</a>. Andrew visualizes what a nascent business could look like in 10 years, including its financials, moats, capital needs, and potential for evolution, to evaluate investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>.

## Firm Building and Management
Howard Marks attributes Oaktree's success to creating a strong culture and having partners with "shared values and complementary skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:18:00">[49:18:00]</a>. He and his partners had worked together for years, establishing a natural division of labor where Howard focused on capital raising and external relations, while others managed money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:00">[50:31:00]</a>. This mutual respect for each other's contributions was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:56:00">[51:56:00]</a>.

Andrew's approach at TQ Ventures is different, focusing on maximizing time spent on investing and striving for world-class returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:45:00">[52:45:00]</a>. They prioritize building strong reputations and relationships with founders, which they believe is the core to success in venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:56:00">[53:56:00]</a>. Their philosophy is not to expand into different strategies or become a large asset manager, but to do what they love and maximize their time doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:27:00">[53:27:00]</a>.

### Investment Strategy and Personality Alignment
Both Howard and Andrew emphasize the importance of choosing an [[investment_strategy_and_personality_alignment | investment strategy]] that suits one's [[finding_the_right_investment_strategy_for_individual_skill_sets | personality and skill set]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>. Howard, a conservative and risk-averse individual, found his fit in credit, while Andrew, an optimist and futurist, thrives in venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:42:00">[40:42:00]</a>. This alignment makes work more enjoyable and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:57:00">[55:57:00]</a>.

## The Concept of "Exit"
Oaktree's transaction with Brookfield was a "dream transaction" that allowed Brookfield to fill a credit gap in its alternative investments while maintaining Oaktree's independence, management, and client relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. It provided an optional exit for founders and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

The discussion also covered the difficult decision of "selling" investments. Howard, from a conservative background, initially favored "taking some money off the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. However, he learned from Andrew that selling too early, especially in "compounding certificates" (companies with perpetual high growth rates), is a huge mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>.

> "Charlie Munger says you only get four good ideas in your life and you got to get the most out of them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:25">[01:29:25]</a>

Decisions to sell should be based on a deep understanding of why the investment was made, how things have evolved, and opportunity costs, rather than solely on price action or fear of regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. In venture, holding truly generational companies is crucial, as they are extremely rare but contribute a huge majority of a firm's returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.

## Judgment and Continuous Learning
Investment success, especially in complex and unpredictable fields, ultimately comes down to "judgment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. This involves:
*   **Second-Level Thinking**: Thinking differently and better than the consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Knowledge and Rationality**: Understanding frameworks, thinking logically, and recognizing one's own biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Humility**: Acknowledging the possibility of being wrong and knowing what one doesn't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

When recruiting, Oaktree seeks "smart eyes"—exceptional people who understand what's important, can go beyond readily available data, and are team players who can exchange ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. In venture, the focus is on evaluating founders, looking for "weirdos" who are "four standard deviations from the mean" in specific areas, willing to think for themselves, and have conviction to go against the herd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>.

The balance between sticking to one's strengths and being open-minded and willing to change is a "conundrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:10">[01:58:10]</a>. Howard notes that while it's important to do what you're good at, "rigidity" is one of the "greatest enemies of profitability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>. This adaptability is key for investors, as well as firms, to thrive in an evolving market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:23">[01:58:23]</a>.
