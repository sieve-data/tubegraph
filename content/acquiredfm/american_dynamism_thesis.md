The "American Dynamism" thesis refers to companies that support the national interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This encompasses sectors ranging from aerospace and defense to fundamental areas like education, housing, transportation, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has established a dedicated practice around this thesis, viewing it as a crucial vertical for venture investing and technology, especially given the unique tailwinds of the current moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Origin and Context
The American Dynamism thesis largely originated from the understanding that the world fundamentally changed with COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This shift emphasized a need to "build" more, moving beyond the "software-only" focus that characterized much of Silicon Valley's innovation in the past 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Historically, Silicon Valley was deeply intertwined with government and defense investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Figures like Don Valentine sold to the Department of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. However, for 20-30 years, there was a prevailing "do not engage" wisdom within venture capital, as working with government was seen as too difficult due to entrenched interests and complex procurement processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

However, many tech companies, like SpaceX and Palantir, were already performing functions traditionally associated with government, assisting intelligence agencies or NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber also transformed public transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This implied that Silicon Valley was already closer to working with government than many realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

Government entities, in turn, are increasingly realizing they need to partner more deeply with the private sector because the best software is being built outside of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Unlike the past, where government often built tools internally (e.g., tanks and battleships) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, modern company building emphasizes using external, specialized tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. The government's current procurement methods for software are outdated, leading to slow and inefficient systems that contrast sharply with the technology used in citizens' private lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

## Categories and Scope
The thesis targets:
*   Companies selling directly to government, like aerospace and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   Companies serving essential civic needs that every citizen cares about, such as education, housing, and transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   Sectors often funded or heavily regulated by government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

These areas, unlike digital health which has seen significant venture capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, have been relatively untouched by technological innovation in the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. For example, the education system often still operates on a 19th-century model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Challenges and "Harder" Companies
Investing in the physical world is challenging because it's "not pure software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. These sectors have:
*   **Entrenched interests and large, existing players** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Regulatory capture**: Existing regulations can stifle new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.
*   **Longer "J-curve"**: These companies often "go deeper down the j-curve," meaning they don't look promising at Series A and take longer to show returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. SpaceX is a prime example, where investors faced fear and worry for its first 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Higher capital requirements and technical risks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

However, these companies often become "holding companies" earlier, attracting finite talent (e.g., in aerospace and defense) and facing less competition compared to consumer or enterprise tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## "Why Now?" – Tailwinds
Several factors make this the opportune moment for American Dynamism:
*   **COVID-19** fundamentally changed the world, prompting a re-evaluation of essential services and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
*   **Shift in Talent**: A new generation of founders, often not traditional engineers, are motivated to solve "real problems" in critical sectors like education, housing, and defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
*   **Ease of Building**: The cost of starting a startup has decreased tremendously due to readily available "off-the-shelf" tools, allowing founders to build without needing to create all their own infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Remote Work and Decentralization**: COVID-19 accelerated the trend of founders building companies from anywhere, leading to a "decentralization of tech" beyond traditional hubs like Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. This means new companies can sprout up in "second and third cities across America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

## Impact on American Society
The **American Dynamism thesis** supports:
*   **Exporting Silicon Valley**: The ability for tech companies to be built outside of traditional tech hubs like San Francisco and New York is game-changing for regional economies, reversing "brain drain" and allowing founders to build for their hometowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>.
*   **Small Business Revolution**: It enables the growth of "small tech" companies that aim to solve the country's big problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. These businesses can use enabling technology like Substack and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Upskilling American Workers**: Companies like Hadrian are focused on training a new generation of skilled workers (e.g., machinists) who can work with modern technology, challenging the notion that value only comes from college education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. This addresses concerns about job creation and the declining middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.

## Contrasting Cultures: Silicon Valley vs. Washington D.C.
The move towards **American Dynamism** highlights the fundamental differences in operating cultures between Silicon Valley and Washington D.C.:
*   **Incentive Structures**: In Silicon Valley, incentives are aligned with a "positive sum mentality," where [[optimism_in_business_success | financial success]] and equity are the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. People are driven to create new things, jobs, and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. There is a culture of [[optimism_in_business_success | abundance]] where multiple winners can exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.
*   **Washington D.C. Culture**: Washington operates on a "zero-sum mindset" where power is the scarce currency, and there can only be a few winners in terms of influence and the news cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. This leads to a "culture of scarcity" despite ever-increasing budgets and headcounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

The historical separation of Silicon Valley from Washington D.C. allowed the former to emerge with a distinct, entrepreneurial history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## Personal Journey: Catherine Boyle
Catherine Boyle's personal journey reflects the shift towards this thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Before becoming a venture capitalist, she was a reporter at the Washington Post from 2010 to early 2014, a period marked by the decline of the journalism industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. She observed that every story she covered involved technology impacting old institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

She left journalism, driven by a desire to "be part of" the biggest story of their time – technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. Her move to Silicon Valley was a "culture shock" due to the intense focus of people on their projects rather than daily news, and the open, collaborative environment where top executives were willing to engage with young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

This experience, starting her career in a "dying industry" and then moving to a "culture of abundance," was formative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. It instilled a perspective of understanding what "death looks like versus momentum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. She believes the best founders often come from a place of "nothing to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

## Examples and Future Outlook
Notable companies aligning with the American Dynamism thesis include:
*   **SpaceX**: An early example of a private, venture-backed company in the space sector that faced initial skepticism but ultimately proved highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Palantir**: A company that helps intelligence agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Flock Safety**: An Atlanta-based Y Combinator company that builds small camera license plate readers to help eliminate crime, selling initially to homeowners associations and then to police departments across 30 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.
*   **Hadrian**: The first formal investment out of the American Dynamism practice at a16z, this Los Angeles-based company is building automated machine shops for aerospace and defense manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. It's addressing the impending crisis of aging [[historical_business_practices_and_corporate_innovation | machine shops]] and the need to upskill American workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
*   **Anduril**: A company focused on modern defense contractors, whose mission has become more appreciated with global events like the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>.

Catherine Boyle expresses strong belief in the "American Experiment" and the [[the_idea_and_vision_of_invest_america_for_inclusive_capitalism | American Dream]], noting that many successful founders are foreign-born, enthusiastic about what the country stands for, and proud of capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. She envisions a future where every venture capital firm has an "American Dynamism" practice, recognizing it as a primary source of American innovation and a category of investing as significant as enterprise or consumer tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.
