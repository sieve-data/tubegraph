The United States healthcare system is characterized by intricate layers of intermediaries, misaligned incentives, and escalating costs, creating a complex and often friction-filled experience for patients and providers alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. Unlike other markets, the typical patient-to-drug purchase pathway involves numerous parties, leading to significant challenges in market function and cost transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>.

## The Labyrinth of Payments and Supply Chain

The journey of a drug from manufacturer to patient is far from straightforward in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

*   **Manufacturers** develop and sell drugs to **Distributors** (e.g., McKesson, Cardinal Health), who warehouse and distribute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>.
*   **Distributors** then sell to **Pharmacies** (e.g., CVS, Walgreens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>.
*   At the pharmacy window, the **consumer** typically does not pay the full price; their **insurance company** does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.
*   To negotiate discounts with manufacturers, insurance companies outsource this task to **Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>.

### The Role of Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs)

PBMs are a critical, yet controversial, part of the US healthcare landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>.

*   **Function:** PBMs negotiate rebates and discounts with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>. They create formularies—lists of drugs and their prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>.
*   **Market Concentration:** While hundreds of PBMs once existed, fewer than 30 remain, with three dominant players (Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, and OptumRx) covering about 80% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:24">[01:28:24]</a>. This consolidation gives them significant gatekeeper power; drug manufacturers often need agreements with all three to ensure broad access for their drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>.
*   **Rebate Mechanism:** Manufacturers pay PBMs rebates, which effectively lower the net price of a drug even if the list price remains high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>. For instance, Eli Lilly has stated that rebates accounted for 75% of insulin's sticker price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>. PBMs typically pass most of these rebates to the healthcare plans, with little reaching the end consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:55">[01:30:55]</a>.
    > "Rebates [are] a game of hide the sausage." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>
    This system obscures demand signals and disassociates the end consumer from the actual cost of their medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>. The complexity is immense, making it difficult to find a single person who can fully comprehend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.

## Economic Challenges and Misaligned Incentives

The US healthcare system's cost burden has dramatically increased. In 1960, healthcare was about 5% of GDP; today, it is 17-18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:38">[03:14:38]</a>.

### Drug Pricing and Accessibility
Drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy highlight the stark price differences within the global market. While Ozempic costs over $1,000 per month in the US (and Wegovy over $1,300), it costs $147 in Canada and $93 in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:30">[02:27:30]</a>. This creates a significant access problem for many Americans, even with insurance subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:47">[02:38:47]</a>.

### The Time Horizon Mismatch in Insurance
A fundamental issue lies in the misaligned time horizons between patients, employers, and private insurers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>.

*   The average American holds a job for 3.7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:34">[02:28:34]</a>, meaning private insurers typically churn patients within that timeframe.
*   Insurers are incentivized to cover only expenses that pay back within this short period or those with overwhelming employee demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>.
*   Long-term conditions, such as obesity leading to future complications (e.g., knee replacements, heart attacks, diabetes treatment), often result in costs borne by future insurers or Medicare, not the current private carrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:28">[02:29:28]</a>.

### Medicare and the Stigma of Obesity
Medicare (health insurance for those over 65) is funded by the US federal government, giving it a longer-term interest in patient health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:01">[02:32:01]</a>. However, Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage, established in 2003) is legally prohibited from covering weight loss drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:53">[02:30:53]</a>. This prohibition is partly due to the persistent stigma that obesity is a personal responsibility problem rather than a disease, despite scientific evidence to the contrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>.

[!INFO] Medical progress has shown that fat tissues release proteins influencing hunger and fullness, which are out of balance in people with obesity, making weight loss and maintenance difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:33">[02:31:33]</a>.

If GLP-1 drugs prove effective in reducing long-term health complications, covering them could be ROI-positive for Medicare, saving future taxpayer dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:48">[02:32:48]</a>. However, the sheer scale of potential demand (40% of the US population is obese) and high list prices mean current budgets cannot fund universal coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:16">[02:34:16]</a>.

## Pharmaceutical Industry Dynamics

The pharmaceutical industry operates on a high-risk, high-reward model, akin to venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:46">[03:11:46]</a>.

*   **R&D Costs:** Bringing a new drug to market costs an average of $2.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>. This figure has significantly increased from $40 million (inflation-adjusted) in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:03">[03:11:03]</a>.
*   **Success Rates:** Only about 10% of drugs entering clinical development make it to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:41">[03:12:41]</a>, and often only one out of those 10 provides half of a company's profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:46">[03:12:46]</a>. Most approved drugs do not even earn back their R&D costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:02">[03:13:02]</a>.
*   **Market Shift:** In recent decades, Pharma has shifted away from mass-population drugs (like statins) towards specialty drugs for rare diseases, which command huge price tags (sometimes millions per dose) for smaller patient populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:31">[03:07:31]</a>. This is partly because FDA approval is harder to obtain for conditions with existing alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:07">[03:10:07]</a>.
*   **"Ars Law":** This term, a play on Moore's Law, suggests that for every next generation, drug development gets more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:40">[03:15:40]</a>.
*   **Consolidation:** The high costs and risks have driven massive consolidation in the industry, enabling companies to pool risk and achieve scale in R&D, production, and go-to-market strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:05">[03:15:05]</a>.

### The Role of GLP-1s
GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy represent a breakthrough in mass-market pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:29">[03:07:29]</a>. Novo Nordisk's long-term, focused investment in diabetes research, unhindered by short-term shareholder pressures due to its unique foundation ownership, allowed it to develop these "miracle drugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:50">[03:05:50]</a>. These drugs not only address diabetes but also offer significant weight loss (15%+ BMI reduction), potentially leading to positive outcomes for cardiovascular, Alzheimer's, and kidney diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a>.

## Broader Societal Challenges

The US healthcare system, originally designed to treat acute and infectious diseases, is ill-equipped for the rise of chronic illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:05">[03:19:05]</a>.

*   **Shifting Disease Landscape:** While infectious diseases once killed children, today's major health challenges are chronic conditions like obesity and cardiovascular disease, which manifest later in life and require a different approach to treatment and payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:39">[03:19:39]</a>.
*   **Declining Life Expectancy:** Despite increased spending, average life expectancy in America has recently declined, partly due to factors outside the healthcare system's control, such as mental health issues and drug overdoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:26">[03:16:26]</a>.
*   **Value Creation vs. Value Capture:** While pharmaceutical companies take significant risks and create immense value through innovation, there's public perception of "over-earning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. However, industry-wide Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) numbers for Pharma are not excessively high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:41">[03:24:41]</a>. In contrast, health insurance companies, which are not true insurers (their profits remained flat or grew during COVID-19, with taxpayers bearing the costs of major crises), are seen as insulated profit centers within an oligopolistic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:57">[03:29:59]</a>.

> "The health insurance companies are not actually insurance, they're access." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:57">[03:29:57]</a>

The [[healthcare_industry_challenges_and_epics_role | US healthcare system challenges]] are deeply rooted in its fragmented, complex, and misaligned structure, making systemic change difficult. While every component often has a rational origin, the cumulative effect is a market that struggles to serve its ultimate customer—the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:10">[03:32:10]</a>.
