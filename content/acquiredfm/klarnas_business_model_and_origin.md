Klarna, founded 19 years ago in Stockholm, Sweden, is primarily known as a buy now, pay later (BNPL) company with broader ambitions in the payments landscape. It currently serves 150 million consumers globally, empowering 2 million payments daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Origin Story and Founding Insight

Sebastian Siemiatkowski, co-founder and CEO of Klarna, was inspired by [[ikeas_business_model_and_strategy|Ikea's business model and strategy]] founder and Richard Branson, sparking a dream of starting a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. After studying at Stockholm School of Economics and taking a sabbatical year, he found himself jobless during the dot-com bubble burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

His unexpected job at an account receivables factoring/collection company, Acme, in 2003, led to the founding insight for Klarna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. While cold-calling businesses, he noticed a particular need among emerging e-commerce companies that were shipping products like cat food obtained via cheap Google AdWords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Traditional mail-order catalog businesses had long offered a "bill me" option, allowing customers to receive and inspect products before paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This "buy now, pay later" model provided safety and trust, especially in Sweden, where debit cards were more common than credit cards, and online shopping felt risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Siemiatkowski realized that e-commerce companies needed a similar solution to what mail-order companies provided, offering an "open invoice payment method" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This was the initial founding insight that remains the core of Klarna's product today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Early Business Model and Profitability

Klarna was founded in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. With an initial investment of $60,000 for 10% of the company, Klarna quickly achieved profitability, spending only $30,000 before reaching that milestone within about six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The business model proved highly effective:
*   **Merchants** loved it because it increased sales and removed the risk of non-payment and administrative burden of collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Consumers** felt more secure using Klarna over debit cards for online purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

The unique aspect of Klarna's early financial model, a "factoring idea," was that it operated with a positive cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Instead of fronting money, Klarna took on the risk and administration of account receivables but didn't pay merchants until three weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This meant merchants were, in effect, funding Klarna for the first few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Some merchants who needed instant payment were charged a higher fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This allowed Klarna to scale using customer funds without needing significant external capital initially, a rare feat for a factoring business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Evolution and Market Adaptation

The term "buy now, pay later" was coined by the Financial Times for Klarna around 2013-2015, before Afterpay was launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

Klarna's initial expansion after Sweden focused on Norway and Finland, driven by existing merchant demand, then Germany and the Netherlands, which had a strong tradition of invoice payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Initially, Klarna was skeptical about the UK and US markets, believing the prevalence of credit cards meant "no need" for their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. However, around 2015, a UK team independently pursued a BNPL strategy for small ticket fashion items and successfully signed Asos, contrary to management's suggestion to focus on high-ticket financing (like Affirm's model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

This shift was driven by a new generation of card users who primarily used debit cards and either didn't have credit cards or disliked using them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. A 2014 McKinsey report, "New Frontiers in credit card segmentation," identified this group as "self-aware avoiders" – individuals with high household incomes who disliked credit card practices (like promoting indebtedness through high limits and low minimum payments) and sought simple, transparent fees and structured payment plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. McKinsey effectively described the BNPL model five years before it gained traction in the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

This created an "innovator's dilemma" for traditional banks, whose business model relied on lending and earning high interest from revolving credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. BNPL offers a model that makes less money per user, which is better for consumers, but less attractive for banks optimized for maximizing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. Klarna's early payment model was simply "buy now, pay later" within 15-30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. While Klarna later introduced revolving and financing for higher ticket items, it moved away from deceptive practices common in banking that maximized consumer interest payments, such as hidden shifts from 0% interest to high-interest revolving accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

Klarna aims to reintroduce the choice between debit and credit that was common in the past (e.g., "press one for debit, press two for credit" at Burger King terminals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. By offering both "pay now" (debit) and "pay later" options, Klarna provides more transparency and control, promoting healthier spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. Today, debit accounts for about 35% of Klarna's volume, with an ambition for it to reach 50/50 online and 80% debit in-store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

## Strategic Shift to Consumer-Centric Model (Post-2015)

From 2010 to 2015, Klarna attempted to "close the loop" by becoming a merchant acquirer and payment service provider (PSP) with "Klarna Checkout" to compete with Stripe and Adyen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. While Klarna Checkout was successful in the Nordics, processing over 50% of all online transactions in the region at one point, it struggled to expand internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. The dominance of Shopify in the US market, which developed its own checkout system, further hampered Klarna's efforts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

By 2015, Klarna decided to pivot away from competing directly with PSPs and instead focus on winning the consumer side, becoming a "digital financial assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. Key aspects of this strategy include:
*   **Global Scale:** Recognizing the need for global distribution to serve more consumers and leverage economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
*   **Data:** Emphasizing the importance of rich consumer data to provide valuable advice and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. Klarna's unique advantage is its SKU-level data on purchases, enabling it to know exactly what a consumer bought, unlike traditional [[visas_business_model_and_structure|Visa's business model and structure]] or MasterCard transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. This granular data allows for better personalization and financial insights.
*   **Brand Building:** Investing in brand recognition, like the "smooth" and pink aesthetic, to compete with big tech (Apple, Amazon), fintechs (Revolut, Chime), and traditional banks (Goldman Sachs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.

To win the US market, particularly against Afterpay's early momentum, Klarna implemented a "browser hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. Through its app, Klarna allows users to generate one-time virtual Visa cards to shop at any online retailer, even where Klarna isn't directly integrated (e.g., Amazon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. The browser experience also allows Klarna to collect SKU-level data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This strategy focused on consumer app downloads, enabling Klarna to claim consumer preference and convert merchants like Sephora and Macy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Today, Klarna mostly relies on acquirers and PSPs like Adyen and Stripe as distributors rather than direct merchant integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

## AI Integration and Future Vision

Inspired by Elon Musk's extreme cost-consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>, Klarna aims for a future where revenue goes up and costs go down, with AI being a key enabler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. While cautious about layoffs, Klarna has stopped general recruiting and is using AI to find efficiencies, reducing internal duplication and manual tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.

A notable application of AI is in customer service. Klarna introduced AI to handle customer inquiries, resulting in a two-thirds reduction in errands for human agents while maintaining comparable customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. This significant outcome has prompted Klarna to share its findings to encourage broader societal discussion about AI's implications for jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

Sebastian Siemiatkowski envisions "Tigers" – companies that will accelerate ahead by deeply integrating AI into their core operations, leading to significantly higher revenue per employee than historically seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. He believes this will lead to a "massive Revival of fintech" and other industries, as agile, AI-powered companies outpace traditional incumbents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.
