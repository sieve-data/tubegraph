Lockheed Martin, the largest defense contractor for the U.S. federal government, plays a critical role in American infrastructure. The company, which is paid approximately $50 billion annually by American taxpayers, is known for manufacturing weapons, often described as "killing machines" or "deterrents" that contribute to maintaining peace and "overwhelming foreign and air superiority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. The history of this company is noted for its "hardcore engineering" and "daring innovators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

The narrative of Lockheed Martin is a complex tapestry woven from about 17 predecessor companies merged over time, with a significant merger between Lockheed and Martin Marietta occurring in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:37">[04:37:37]</a>. The story focuses on two interwoven golden eras of Lockheed (before the Martin merger): the famed [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] and Lockheed's direct ties to the birth of [[connections_between_defense_innovation_and_silicon_valley | Silicon Valley]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

## Early History of Lockheed

The first Lockheed company was founded in 1912 by Allan Lockheed, whose surname was originally spelled "Loughhead" but was changed to avoid mispronunciations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:37">[04:47:37]</a>. Allan and his brother Malcolm, based in San Francisco, started with a single plane, the Model G, flying tourists over the bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:05">[05:30:05]</a>. Malcolm later moved to Detroit and invented the modern hydraulic brake system for automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:02">[05:49:02]</a>.

Notably, John Northrop, a co-founder of the second Lockheed company, later founded Northrop, which became Northrop Grumman—making him a major figure in three of the five remaining defense prime contractors today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

After the first company failed, a second Lockheed company found success with the Vega airplane, a favorite of early aviators like Amelia Earhart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This company was eventually sold to the "Detroit Aircraft Corporation" (DAC), an initiative aiming to build the "General Motors of the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. However, aviation did not become a consumer industry like automobiles, and the DAC went bankrupt during the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

The Lockheed division, still profitable, was sold out of bankruptcy to Robert Gross for $40,000 in 1932, a price so low that Allan Lockheed himself considered bidding more to buy it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Under Robert Gross and his brother Cortland, Lockheed became the prominent company it is known as today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. They developed the Elektra airplane, famously depicted in *Casablanca* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

## World War II and the Birth of [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]]

World War II transformed Lockheed. Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, an engineer who joined Lockheed in 1933 and was instrumental in designing the Elektra, became a central figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Johnson was known for his intuitive understanding of physics and his demanding, hands-on approach to design, often flight-testing planes himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

Lockheed's first wartime contribution was adapting the Electra into the Hudson bomber, which the British Royal Air Force purchased extensively before the U.S. entered the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Kelly Johnson then designed the P-38 Lightning fighter, which became the U.S.'s elite, fastest, and most maneuverable aircraft, with over 10,000 produced during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

By late 1944, two major problems emerged for the U.S.: the appearance of German jet-powered fighters (like the Messer Schmidt Me 262 "Swallow" which flew over 100 mph faster than Allied planes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, and concerns about the Soviet Union becoming a future adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

To address the jet problem, the U.S. government tasked Kelly Johnson and Lockheed with creating a jet fighter prototype within 180 days that could exceed 600 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Johnson selected 23 top engineers and 30 shop people, renting a circus tent next to a plastics factory in Burbank, California, to house them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. The noxious smell from the factory, combined with a popular comic strip character's moonshine still called "Skunk Works," gave the division its famous name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

This elite team built the first prototype U.S. fighter jet, the Lulu Bell (which became the P-80 Shooting Star), in just 143 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. This feat, achieved by focusing solely on core competencies and outsourcing everything else (like the Halford H1B Goblin engine from a British company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>, marked the beginning of [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]]' unique operational philosophy.

[!INFO] The Skunk Works Philosophy
[[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] operated on principles emphasizing rapid delivery of superior products, often driven by existential threats. Kelly Johnson codified these principles into 14 rules, including:
*   **Restricted personnel:** "The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>
*   **Complete control:** The manager must have "practically complete control of his program in all aspects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.
*   **Proximity to production:** Engineers and designers worked "only steps away from the shop workers to make quick structural or parts changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>.
*   **Reward for impact, not supervision:** Kelly Johnson prioritized rewarding individuals who "supervises the least" because "he's doing more and taking more responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>.

This small, highly motivated group operated with low overhead and financial risk, borrowing talent from the main plant as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>.

## [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | The U2 Spy Plane]]: Eyes in the Sky

The second major problem emerging after WWII was the impending Cold War with the Soviet Union, especially after the Soviets detonated their first nuclear bomb in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>. The U.S. adopted a policy of mutually assured destruction (MAD), requiring robust intelligence capabilities to deter a Soviet first strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>.

This intelligence need led the CIA to contract [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] to develop the [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2 spy plane]] in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>. The target was a plane that could fly stealthily or high enough to avoid being shot down, at an unprecedented altitude of 70,000 feet (compared to the then-maximum of 40,000 feet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>. This required innovations in jet fuel (developed with Shell Oil) and the creation of full spacesuits for pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>. The [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] prototype was completed and delivered in just a year and a half for $3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>.

The camera system for the [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] was developed by Dr. Edwin Land and the Polaroid company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>. Testing of the [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] (a plane with a 100-foot wingspan) required an isolated location, leading [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] to establish a test site at Groom Lake, Nevada, which became known as Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:57:00">[43:57:00]</a>. Unexplained sightings of the strange-looking plane and spacesuit-clad pilots contributed to UFO rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:53:00">[46:53:00]</a>.

The first [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] overflight of the Soviet Union occurred on July 4, 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:52:00">[48:52:00]</a>. While the Soviets tracked it on radar, they could not hit it, allowing the U.S. to gather crucial intelligence for years without Soviet public acknowledgment (as admitting they tracked it would reveal their inability to stop it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>. The [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] provided real-time counts of Soviet warheads, fighter jets, and radar capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:16:00">[52:16:00]</a>.

The [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] program over Russia ended on May 1, 1960, when Francis Gary Powers' [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] was shot down by a newly developed Soviet missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07:00">[53:07:00]</a>. This was the first time a ground-to-air missile had shot down an airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:29:00">[53:29:00]</a>. Powers survived and was captured, leading to the public revelation of the [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:39:00">[54:39:00]</a>.

## [[connections_between_defense_innovation_and_silicon_valley | Connections between Defense Innovation and Silicon Valley]]

After the [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] incident, the U.S. faced a critical intelligence gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:12:00">[56:12:00]</a>. This gap was addressed by a new, highly secretive Lockheed division: the Lockheed Missile Systems Division (LMMSC), which had an even greater impact on the country and the company than [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:55:00">[56:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:39">[01:08:39]</a>.

LMMSC was established in 1954 in an unmarked building in Burbank, initially copying [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]]' management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. However, missile development required expertise in radar and computing, areas where Southern California was not strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

This led LMMSC to [[connections_between_defense_innovation_and_silicon_valley | Silicon Valley]] in 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. The move was heavily influenced by Frederick Terman, a Stanford Professor and former head of Harvard's wartime radio lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. Terman, a devoted patriot, recruited top radio engineering minds to Stanford, changed the university's tech transfer policies to encourage commercial spin-outs, and carved off a part of Stanford's campus to create the Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This park became the hub for early tech companies like Hewlett-Packard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.

LMMSC became one of the very first and largest tenants of the Stanford Industrial Park, quickly expanding to a massive campus in Sunnyvale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>. By 1959, LMMSC employed nearly 20,000 people, growing to 30,000 by the mid-1960s, making it by far the largest employer in proto-[[connections_between_defense_innovation_and_silicon_valley | Silicon Valley]] (compared to Hewlett-Packard's 3,000 employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. LMMSC's demand for advanced computing and silicon components fueled the growth of early chip companies like Fairchild Semiconductor, where Don Valentine (later Sequoia Capital founder) sold to defense firms like Lockheed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. Notably, Steve Wozniak's father, Jerry Wozniak, moved his family to [[connections_between_defense_innovation_and_silicon_valley | Silicon Valley]] to become an engineer at LMMSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>, highlighting Lockheed's foundational role in the region's tech ecosystem.

### Under the Oceans: Polaris Missiles

One of LMMSC's most significant projects was the Navy's Fleet Ballistic Missile system, Polaris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>. The challenge was to fire intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from submarines, ideally from *under* the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>. This innovation was a game-changer for deterrence, as mobile, undetectable nuclear submarines would guarantee a second strike capability, preventing a Soviet first strike against land-based ICBMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.

In December 1955, Lockheed received the Polaris contract, and just over four years later, in 1960, the first U.S. nuclear ballistic missile-equipped submarine launched, armed with Lockheed Polaris A1 undersea-fired nuclear warheads capable of reaching targets 1,200 nautical miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. This success led to successor programs like Poseidon and Trident, with Trident missiles achieving a 5,000-mile range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.

### To Space: Satellite Surveillance

The U.S. intelligence gap after the [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] shootdown in May 1960 was quickly filled by LMMSC's secret space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. While NASA focused on basic science and manned spaceflight, LMMSC was developing fully operational observational spy satellites concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

The first such program, Corona, launched its first satellite in August 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>. Using a cover story of "life form research," Corona satellites carried camera systems capable of photographing any ground location at a resolution as low as five feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:12">[01:33:12]</a>. The very first Corona mission produced more photographic coverage of the Soviet Union than all previous [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] flights combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:24">[01:34:24]</a>.

[!INFO] Film Return from Space
The Corona satellites used film-based systems, requiring a unique method for data retrieval. Film canisters (called "film buckets" and designed by General Electric) were dropped from orbit, re-entered the atmosphere, and deployed parachutes at 60,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:37">[01:35:37]</a>. These capsules were designed to be caught in mid-air by a Lockheed C-130 airplane towing a special claw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>. If missed, a salt plug in the canister would dissolve after two days, sinking the film to the bottom of the sea, preventing enemy capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:30">[01:37:30]</a>.

Over 800,000 images were taken by Corona satellites during the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This system, along with the Aegina rocket (which pioneered second-stage rocket boosters), achieved numerous space firsts, including circular orbits, polar orbits, 3-axis stabilization, ground control, and returning man-made objects from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

Corona led to more advanced programs:
*   **Gambit (1963):** Improved resolution (under two feet), surpassing [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>.
*   **Hexagon:** Longer orbit lifespans and greater film capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Kennen (1977):** First real-time space-based surveillance system, leveraging digital photography and communication satellites. Lockheed built custom digital workstations to process these images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>.

LMMSC also pioneered weather satellites and contributed to the development of the GPS system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>. Beyond military applications, LMMSC built the Hubble Telescope, while Martin Marietta (later part of Lockheed Martin) built the space shuttle's large orange fuel tank that carried it into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

LMMSC became the "Crown Jewel" of Lockheed, often generating over 100% of the company's profits during difficult times in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Its focus on technology problems, computing, and silicon (which offered better margins than airplanes) contributed to its profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:40">[01:50:40]</a>. LMMSC's operating philosophy included "focus on a threat-based need," emphasizing market context, unlike Kelly Johnson's sole focus on "rapid delivery of Superior Products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:18">[01:52:18]</a>.

## Return to [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]]: The SR-71 Blackbird and Stealth

When the [[development_and_impact_of_the_u2_spy_plane | U2]] was shot down in 1960, [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] was already developing its successor: the A-12 Oxcart, which later evolved into the SR-71 Blackbird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:36">[01:56:36]</a>. The strategy shifted from flying high to flying *fast* to evade missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>. The A-12 was designed to cruise at Mach 3 or faster (over 2,000 mph), making it faster than a rifle bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a>.

[!NOTE] SR-71 Engineering Marvels
*   **Materials:** The Blackbird's skin reached 500°F and areas near engines almost 1,000°F, requiring the plane to be built almost entirely from titanium, a metal notoriously difficult to machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>. Much of this titanium was secretly sourced from the Soviet Union through dummy corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>.
*   **Panel Gaps & Fuel:** Due to thermal expansion, the Blackbird's panels fit loosely on the ground, leading to fuel leaks. A custom, non-flammable fuel was developed by Shell so it wouldn't ignite while leaking on the tarmac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>.
*   **Engines:** Ben Rich's team engineered the "spike inlet system" for the Pratt & Whitney J58 engines. These iconic cones provided three-quarters of the thrust needed for sustained Mach 3+ flight by supercharging and compressing massive amounts of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:23">[02:05:23]</a>.
*   **Navigation:** At 84,000 feet, the curvature of the Earth is visible, and ground landmarks move too fast for navigation. A new system, colloquially known as an "R2D2," was developed to navigate by the stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Stealth:** The Blackbird was also an early stealth aircraft. Its flat bottom design bounced radar waves away from the transmitter, making it difficult to detect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:46">[02:11:46]</a>. Rivets were made flush with the skin to avoid radar reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>.

The SR-71, a two-seater Air Force version of the CIA's single-seater A-12, began test flights in April 1962 at Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:19">[02:07:19]</a>. It achieved Mach 3.4 and earned Kelly Johnson his second Collier Trophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a>. The SR-71 never carried guns, only cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:33">[02:06:33]</a>. It is believed to have never been shot down, with over 4,000 missiles reportedly fired at Blackbirds without a single hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:20">[02:09:20]</a>. The SR-71's first flight was closer in time to the Wright brothers' flight than to today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>.

Despite its capabilities, the Blackbird was expensive to build ($33 million per plane) and maintain ($300 million annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>. In 1970, the Pentagon cancelled further orders and ordered [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] to destroy all titanium tooling to prevent future production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:26">[02:14:26]</a>.

### The F-117A Nighthawk

After Kelly Johnson's retirement, Ben Rich took over [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:57">[02:17:57]</a>. In the mid-1970s, a mathematician named Dennis Overholser at [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] discovered a Russian paper containing equations that could make an aircraft virtually invisible to radar, like a "BB on a radar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>. Despite Kelly Johnson's skepticism about its aerodynamic feasibility, Rich pursued the project, internally funding a prototype called "Have Blue" (nicknamed "Hopeless Diamond") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:09">[02:26:09]</a>.

This prototype, which looked like a "Star Fox Super Nintendo plane" with its faceted, non-rounded surfaces, proved to have a radar signature smaller than an eighth of an inch sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. Lockheed Martin collaborated with Sega on the Model 3 arcade board to model stealth airplanes, leveraging gaming graphics technology to refine stealth design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:56">[02:50:56]</a>.

[[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] won the contract to build the Air Force's stealth fighter, the F-117A Nighthawk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>. The plane's instability was overcome using early fly-by-wire computer controls, which translated pilot intentions into stabilized movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:58">[02:29:58]</a>. The Air Force took delivery in 1983, ultimately buying 59 Nighthawks at $43 million each, generating $2.5 billion in revenue for Lockheed during a period of financial difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

The Nighthawk's combat debut came during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, where it famously neutralized Baghdad's defenses on the first night of the war, hitting 40% of all damaged targets while flying only 1% of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>. The Nighthawk's success marked a "Quantum advance in air warfare," demonstrating the effectiveness of surprise, surgically precise raids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:56">[02:32:56]</a>.

## Post-Cold War and the [[innovation_in_defense_and_government_sectors | Innovation]] Landscape

The end of the Cold War and the success of the U.S. military in the Gulf War led to a period of consolidation within the defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:15">[02:34:15]</a>. In July 1993, Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry convened the CEOs of major defense contractors at a dinner, instructing them to merge and consolidate, as defense budgets would shrink drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:37">[02:35:37]</a>. This event, dubbed "the Last Supper" by Martin Marietta's CEO Norm Augustine, kicked off an era of intentional government-mandated consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:17">[02:36:17]</a>.

Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, forming Lockheed Martin, a company composed of 17 previously independent entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:22">[02:44:22]</a>. In 1997, a planned merger with Northrop Grumman was blocked by the Department of Justice to preserve competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Current major programs include:
*   **F-22 Raptor:** Identified in 1981, the F-22 program initially envisioned 750 planes for $44 billion. Due to budget cuts, only 187 planes were delivered, costing $360 million each (amortizing R&D costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. The F-22, built in 46 states and employing 95,000 jobs, demonstrates the pervasive "pork barrel politics" of defense contracting, where projects are designed to ensure broad Congressional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:54">[02:52:54]</a>.
*   **F-35 Lightning II (Joint Strike Fighter):** A massive international program designed to achieve economies of scale across U.S. armed services and allies. It features three models, including one with vertical takeoff capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:30">[02:54:30]</a>. The F-35 prioritizes "information-based warfare" with advanced communication and heads-up displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:38">[02:55:38]</a>. Initial orders were for 3,000 planes worth $200 billion, with the U.S. alone ordering 398 for $30 billion ($75 million per plane) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:14">[02:56:14]</a>.

### Implications for [[innovation_in_defense_and_government_sectors | Innovation]]

Lockheed Martin today is a diversified conglomerate, with Aeronautics (dominated by the F-35) as its largest segment, alongside Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems (including Sikorsky helicopters), and Space (including the Orion Capsule and the ULA joint venture with Boeing for launch services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:42">[03:09:42]</a>.

The U.S. defense budget is $800 billion annually, with Lockheed Martin receiving $50 billion as the single largest federal contractor across all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:30">[03:00:30]</a>. Lockheed Martin operates on an average net income margin of 8%, largely due to cost-plus contracting models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:48">[03:01:48]</a>. This model ensures the contractor does not bear the risk of R&D costs, as the government pays for all expenses plus a fixed profit margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:11">[03:02:11]</a>.

[!WARNING] The Military-Industrial Complex
The "military industrial Congressional complex" is characterized by a unique dynamic where a single customer (the U.S. government) dictates the market. This system aims to maintain America's military-industrial base and ensure a trained workforce for national security, even if it means funding companies to "keep them alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:11">[03:19:11]</a>. This often results in inefficient, costly programs (like the F-22) that generate jobs across many states, creating political incentives for their funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:31">[02:53:31]</a>.

Critics argue that this system can lead to "misappropriation of funds" and that military spending creates fewer jobs than other public investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:23">[03:22:23]</a>. The current system, while maintaining capability, contrasts sharply with the agile, small-team approach of early [[the_evolution_and_significance_of_skunk_works | Skunk Works]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:50">[03:26:50]</a>. The shift from Kelly Johnson's era, where engineers "could Intuit the answer to difficult math problems in his head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a> to today's complex, multi-state projects, suggests a slower pace of [[innovation in defense and government sectors | innovation]] in traditional aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:49">[02:57:49]</a>. As Norm Augustine famously quipped, if current cost trends continue, by 2054, "the entire defense budget will purchase just one aircraft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:08">[03:29:08]</a>.

The initial rapid [[innovation in defense and government sectors | innovation]] seen in the Cold War era, driven by existential threats, injected a "Skunk Works mentality" into [[connections_between_defense_innovation_and_silicon_valley | Silicon Valley]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. While the military-industrial complex has evolved to prioritize maintaining an industrial base, the ability to achieve "unbelievable, unfathomable things with a small number of people in an unrealistically tight time frame" (like the COVID-19 vaccine "Operation Warp Speed") still exists, often outside of the traditional defense contracting behemoths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:52">[03:27:52]</a>. The focus has shifted from the threat of nuclear war to other domains, such as cyber security and information warfare, which may call for different approaches to defense innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:52">[03:27:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:22">[03:05:22]</a>.
