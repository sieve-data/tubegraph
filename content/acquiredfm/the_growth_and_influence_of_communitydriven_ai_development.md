Hugging Face has emerged as a central platform for AI builders, positioning itself at the heart of the evolving AI landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The company aims to provide a clear understanding of [[open_source_ai_vs_closed_ai_ecosystems | Open Source AI vs Closed AI ecosystems]] and its closed counterparts, detailing their differences, trade-offs, and virtues through its own story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Hugging Face: A Platform for AI Builders

Hugging Face has become the leading platform for "AI Builders," who are described as the new software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Unlike previous technology paradigms that relied on writing millions of lines of code, modern technology creation involves training models using datasets and building AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Most AI builders today use Hugging Face to find models, datasets, and develop apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The platform serves over 5 million AI builders daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Scale and Scope

As of recording, Hugging Face is valued at $4.5 billion, with investors including [[ai_and_machine_learning_insights_from_nvidia | Nvidia]], Salesforce, Google, Amazon, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The platform has over 3 million models, datasets, and applications shared collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Noteworthy models hosted include Llama 3.1, Stable Diffusion for images, Whisper for audio, and Flux for images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The platform is nearing 1 million public models shared, with almost as many being used internally and privately by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. A model, dataset, or app is built on Hugging Face every 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Analogy to GitHub

Hugging Face's ecosystem is often compared to GitHub, serving as a repository for AI models, datasets, and applications, allowing for both public open-source sharing and internal private use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. While AI differs from traditional software, Hugging Face occupies a similar position as the most used platform for this new class of technology builders, just as GitHub did for software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Core Features

Beyond hosting, Hugging Face provides crucial collaboration features. Building AI often requires teamwork across individuals, teams, and even external collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Features like commenting on models, datasets, and apps, versioning code, models, and data, and bug reporting are heavily used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This collaborative environment enables larger teams to build AI together, with thousands of users at companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Salesforce using the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## The Origin Story: From Chatbot to AI Powerhouse

Hugging Face was co-founded in 2016 by Clem Delong, Julian, and Thomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Initially, it was a chatbot primarily aimed at teenagers, named after the hugging face emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The founders were driven by an early passion for AI, then often referred to as machine learning or deep learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. They aimed to build an "AI Tamagotchi" – a fun, conversational AI pet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. They spent three years on this idea, raising their first two rounds of funding based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Early investors included BetaWorks in New York and the Conway family with SV Angel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:10:00]</a>.

### The Pivotal Moment

The company's significant pivot occurred around 2017, when the Transformer paper was released by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. At this time, the state-of-the-art for natural language processing still relied on smaller models and specific datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The pivot was sparked when Thomas, Hugging Face's chief scientist and third co-founder, ported Google's BERT Transformer model from TensorFlow to PyTorch over a weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:13:16]</a>. The release garnered a surprisingly large amount of attention from the developer community, signaling a strong demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Community-Driven Evolution

This unexpected interest led Hugging Face to develop an abstraction layer for managing multiple models and datasets, a necessity for their original chatbot idea which required handling various topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This became the foundation for what Hugging Face is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The company's growth was very organic, following community feedback. Other scientists wanted to add their models (like XLNet and GPT-2 from OpenAI, when it was still open source) to Hugging Face's library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:15:19]</a>. What started as a single model repository evolved into "Transformers," and then expanded into the broader Hugging Face platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:43]</a>. Users then requested features for hosting larger models and datasets, which solidified Hugging Face as a "new GitHub for AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:42]</a>. This community-driven development has been a major factor in its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Openness

Hugging Face is famously open, embracing community feedback and even having an internal open policy for social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:34]</a>. This openness is about providing tools for companies to be more open, without forcing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Approximately half of the models, datasets, and apps built on the platform are private, used internally by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:10]</a>.

### [[open_source_ai_vs_closed_ai_ecosystems | Open Source AI vs Closed AI ecosystems]] Foundation

The debate between [[open_source_ai_vs_closed_ai_ecosystems | Open Source AI vs Closed AI ecosystems]] can be misleading, as open source forms the foundation for all AI, including those developed by "closed source" companies like OpenAI and Anthropic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:27:13]</a>. In earlier years (2017-2019), most AI research and models from entities like Google and OpenAI were shared publicly, fostering rapid progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:28:14]</a>.

However, in the last two to three years, the field has become less open due to commercial considerations and "misleading arguments" around safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:44]</a>. Some argue that sharing research is dangerous, citing "existential risk" if a bad actor gets a hold of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:19]</a>. Hugging Face views this argument as a recurring pattern in technology cycles (like concerns over books or nuclear technology), suggesting that the "AI" name itself contributes to heightened fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:30:17]</a>.

### Safety and Decentralization

From Hugging Face's perspective, openness (open AI, open science) lifts all boats, enabling everyone to build, understand, and gain transparency into AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:15]</a>. This ultimately leads to a safer future. A decentralized AGI, with technology accessible to private companies, policymakers, nonprofits, and civil society, is preferred over a centralized one controlled by a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:52]</a>.

## AI as "Software 2.0"

Clem Delong prefers to call AI "Software 2.0," arguing that it's a new paradigm for building technology, rather than focusing on sci-fi or superintelligence concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:53]</a>.

### Beyond AGI Hype

Current models are seen as building blocks for AGI, but the term "artificial intelligence" often creates misconceptions, linking it to sci-fi scenarios like "Robocop" or "all-dominating AI systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:21:16]</a>. The ability to build a good chatbot, while impressive, is viewed as a natural progression of technology rather than a sudden, mind-blowing breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:45]</a>. This perspective highlights the continuous progress of technology, similar to the advent of vehicles or search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:23:17]</a>.

### Leverage for Builders

AI, as Software 2.0, provides immense leverage for humans to scale and do more, similar to how traditional software enabled greater output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:32]</a>. The richness of applications that can be built quickly is astonishing, representing a "10x improvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:47]</a>. This new paradigm is exciting enough without needing to rely on Doomsday scenarios or AGI hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:54]</a>.

## Rethinking AI Startup Models

The emergence of AI changes how companies are built and how investments are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:32]</a>. Building an AI startup is "very different" from building a traditional software startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:50]</a>.

### Capital Requirements

Some AI startups, especially those developing foundational models, require substantial capital for compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:12]</a>. This impacts investment returns and burn rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:26]</a>. While most investment currently goes to foundational LLMs (text models), there's potential for foundational models in other modalities like video, biology, chemistry, audio, and image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:56]</a>. The assumption that most dollars will go to large training runs is an open question, and there's no clear "recipe" for AI startups yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:21]</a>.

### The Role of Scientists

AI is fundamentally more science-driven than traditional software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:06]</a>. Thus, having a co-founder with a science background is considered a "must" or a "big plus" for AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:56:09]</a>. The mindset differs: software emphasizes fast shipping and incremental improvements (e.g., 5% better product every two weeks), while science involves longer development cycles that can yield 10x improvements after months of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:58:16]</a>.

### New Playbooks for Investment

The traditional software playbook (small co-founder team, Lean Startup methodology, rapid iterations) may not apply to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:36:13]</a>. AI startups might require heavy capital investment before seeing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:36:04]</a>. Hugging Face advises entrepreneurs to "trash their Lean Startup book" when starting an AI company and instead "start from scratch" with first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:41]</a>.

## Hugging Face's Sustainable Business Model

Hugging Face has raised over $500 million in seven years but has spent less than half of that, managing to be profitable—an unusual feat for many AI startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:52]</a>.

### Profitability and Community

Hugging Face's business model leverages its widespread free usage. A "straightforward and permissive freemium model" allows them to achieve meaningful revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:27]</a>. Being a community platform, long-term sustainability and profitability are crucial to fulfill their responsibility to users who build and contribute to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:40:13]</a>.

### Value-Add over Compute Race

Hugging Face avoids the "race to the bottom on compute" prices against hyperscalers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:42:12]</a>. Instead, they provide significant value through platform features and integrated compute offerings (like inference endpoints or spaces GPUs) that make the process "10 times easier" for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:55]</a>. By offering a seamless, less complex experience, companies are willing to pay a markup, effectively reducing the need for large ML infrastructure teams (e.g., 1-2 ML engineers instead of 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:43:39]</a>. They also generate high-margin revenue from offerings like their Enterprise Hub, a paid version of The Hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:17]</a>.

## Challenges of an AI Platform

One inherent challenge for Hugging Face as a platform is its "curse of visibility" or "sexiness." Like GitHub, it empowers the technology-building process but remains largely in the background, less visible than product-focused companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:47:48]</a>.

### Visibility and Innovation Pace

Another challenge is the constant battle between building a mature, stable platform and innovating fast enough to avoid missing the next wave of rapidly evolving underlying AI technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:41]</a>. With 250 team members, Hugging Face aims to remain an order of magnitude smaller than its peers (e.g., 200 vs. 2,000 people) to reconcile the need for speed with building tools at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:49:13]</a>.

### The "Unintuitive" API Model

While many AI companies currently use APIs from foundational model providers, Hugging Face considers this a "transitional time" rather than the optimal long-term approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:50:06]</a>. Similar to early web development needing no-code platforms like Squarespace or Dreamweaver before companies learned to code themselves, companies are using APIs because building AI themselves is still too difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:54]</a>.

## The Future of AI Development

Hugging Face believes that eventually, all tech companies will be AI companies, building and fine-tuning their own models optimized for specific use cases, constraints, and domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:22]</a>. This contradicts the view that only a few large players will control foundational models and the majority will consume their APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:47]</a>.

### Growth of AI Builders

Based on Hugging Face's platform usage, there are an estimated 5 million AI builders globally today, compared to about 50 million software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:06:13]</a>. It's plausible that in a few years, there could be 50-100 million AI builders, potentially even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:30]</a>. The barrier to entry for contributing to AI (e.g., contributing expertise or data) can be lower than learning a programming language for software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:07:00]</a>.

### Empowering a New Generation of Companies

This growth in AI builders could mean 10 times more people contributing to and shaping technology, leading to more inclusive and socially beneficial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:45]</a>. AI represents "the opportunity of the century to shake things up, break the monopolies, and break the established positions and do something a bit new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:12]</a>. Hugging Face envisions a future where many AI companies win, potentially more than software companies in the past, rather than just a few dominant players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:39]</a>.
