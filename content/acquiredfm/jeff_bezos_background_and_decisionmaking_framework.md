This article delves into the early life, education, and career of Jeff Bezos, tracing the influences that shaped his decision to found [[Amazoncoms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Amazon.com]], which would become one of the most impactful businesses of the past 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>.

## Early Life and Family

Born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Bezos's early life was marked by unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>.

*   **Biological Parents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>: His mother, Jackie, was 16 and his father, Ted Jorgensen, was 18 when she became pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. They married before Jeff's birth but divorced when he was about 18 months old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Maternal Grandparents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>: After the divorce, Jackie moved back in with her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. His grandfather, Lawrence Preston Gise (Pop Geesy), was head of Sandia National Laboratories, which managed the U.S. nuclear weapons program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. He was also an original member of DARPA, which encouraged the development of the ARPANET (precursor to the internet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Pop Geesy had a significant influence on Jeff, introducing him to science fiction and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Adopted Father, Mike Bezos** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>: When Jeff was four, Jackie remarried Miguel "Mike" Bezos Perez, a petroleum engineer for Exxon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Mike was a Cuban immigrant who came to the U.S. as part of an exfiltration program for gifted youngsters, living in a group home in Wilmington, Delaware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. He quickly learned English, earned a full scholarship to the University of Albuquerque, and worked at a local bank where he met Jackie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Mike adopted Jeff, and the family later moved to Houston, where Jeff grew up during the Apollo era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Summers on the Ranch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>: From age four, Jeff spent every summer on his grandparents' 24,000-acre ranch in West Texas, 100 miles from the nearest retail outlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This environment fostered self-sufficiency, with them building their own tools, performing veterinary work, and rebuilding farm equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This ranch would later become the base for Blue Origin's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Education and Early Career

*   **Early Promise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>: Jeff attended a Montessori preschool in Houston and was placed in a new program for gifted students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. He was even chosen as the subject for a book on gifted education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. A quote from his teacher noted, "there is probably no limit to what he can do given a little guidance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **High School and Princeton** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>: The family moved to Florida for his high school years, where he graduated as valedictorian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. He then attended Princeton, studying computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. While there, he was president of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS) club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **First Job: Fitel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>: After graduating in 1986, Bezos worked for Fitel, a startup developing high-speed network technology for trading applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This experience provided him with an understanding of networked computing and its practical implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Bankers Trust and Halsey Minor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>: In 1988, he moved into finance, joining the investment bank Bankers Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He also befriended Halsey Minor and almost started a financial newsletter startup with him; Minor later founded CNET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **[[jeff_bezos_transition_from_hedge_fund_to_founding_amazon | D. E. Shaw & Co.]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>: In 1990, a headhunter convinced him to interview at D. E. Shaw, a quantitative hedge fund founded by David E. Shaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Bezos quickly rose to become the fourth senior vice president, the youngest at the firm, and developed a close relationship with David Shaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. The firm prided itself on attracting smart people from diverse disciplines, not just finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. It was here that Jeff recruited early [[Amazoncoms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Amazon]] employees like Jeff Holden and Nicholas Lovejoy, and met his future wife, [[jeff_bezos_and_mckenzie_bezos_financial_growth | MacKenzie Scott Tuttle]], who became the first [[Amazoncoms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Amazon]] employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Ideation and The Regret Minimization Framework

At D. E. Shaw, Jeff led projects like the "third market business" for retail stock trading and launched internet ventures like an online retail brokerage and Juno, one of the first free email services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

He and David Shaw began brainstorming internet opportunities, conceiving the "Everything Store" – an intermediary layer bypassing traditional retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Bezos identified books as the ideal starting category due to their commodity nature, few major distributors, and vast long-tail selection (3 million active books) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This approach leveraged the internet's ability to create a "true Superstore" that couldn't exist physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

> [!quote] Jeff Bezos
> "With that huge diversity of products, 3 million books in print, you could build a store online that simply could not exist in any other way. You could build a true Superstore with exhaustive selection and custom value selection." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>

Bezos's conviction grew from observing the internet's explosive growth: web traffic grew 230,000% from January 1993 to January 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. Recognizing this "fish in a barrel" opportunity, he contemplated leaving his lucrative career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

> "When I'm 80 years old and I'm looking back on my life and I look back at this fork in the road here, which path am I going to regret the least? What will cause the least amount of regret when I am 80 and I'm looking back and I made that decision do I regret it more or less than what the alternative would have been?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>

Applying his "regret minimization framework," Bezos realized he would deeply regret not pursuing the internet opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Despite parental advice to stay at D. E. Shaw and David Shaw's offer to keep him, Bezos decided to leave and build the "Everything Store" himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## Founding the Company

*   **Initial Struggles and Location** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>: Jeff's initial fundraising was difficult, raising just $1 million from 22 investors over 60 meetings, selling 20% of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. He chose Seattle for [[Amazoncoms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Amazon]]'s base due to its proximity to book distributor Ingram in Oregon, Washington state's lack of sales tax nexus (due to a 1992 Supreme Court ruling), and access to tech talent from Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Naming the Company** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>: Initial name ideas included "Kadabra" (misheard as "cadaver") and "Relentless.com" (which still redirects to Amazon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. He settled on "Amazon" by looking in a dictionary, noting it was the "Earth's largest river" for "Earth's largest selection," and starting with "A" for alphabetical directory listings like Yahoo! <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Funding and Operations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>: Jeff and MacKenzie invested $95,000, joined by $5,000 from first engineer Shell Kapphan and $100,000 from Jeff's parents, Mike and Jackie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. Jeff also took a book-selling course to learn the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.# Jeff Bezos: Background and Decision-Making Framework

Bezos's conviction grew from observing the internet's explosive growth: web traffic grew 230,000% from January 1993 to January 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. Recognizing this "fish in a barrel" opportunity, he contemplated leaving his lucrative career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

Applying his "regret minimization framework," Bezos realized he would deeply regret not pursuing the internet opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Despite parental advice to stay at D. E. Shaw and David Shaw's offer to keep him, Bezos decided to leave and build the "Everything Store" himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## Founding the Company

*   **Initial Struggles and Location** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>: Jeff's initial fundraising was difficult, raising just $1 million from 22 investors over 60 meetings, selling 20% of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. He chose Seattle for [[Amazoncoms Early Business Strategy and Growth | Amazon]]'s base due to its proximity to book distributor Ingram in Oregon, Washington state's lack of sales tax nexus (due to a 1992 Supreme Court ruling), and access to tech talent from Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Naming the Company** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>: Initial name ideas included "Kadabra" (misheard as "cadaver") and "Relentless.com" (which still redirects to Amazon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. He settled on "Amazon" by looking in a dictionary, noting it was the "Earth's largest river" for "Earth's largest selection," and starting with "A" for alphabetical directory listings like Yahoo! <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Funding and Operations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>: Jeff and [[Jeff Bezos and McKenzie Bezos financial growth | MacKenzie]] invested $95,000, joined by $5,000 from first engineer Shell Kapphan and $100,000 from Jeff's parents, Mike and Jackie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. Jeff also took a book-selling course to learn the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.
