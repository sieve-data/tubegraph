From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

International Computers Limited (ICL) was established in 1968 by the British government through a forced merger of three computer manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The government aimed for ICL to be the United Kingdom's equivalent to [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]], serving as a national champion in the computing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite the UK's pioneering role in computing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, ICL ultimately failed to compete with American and East Asian rivals and was eventually sold to Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article traces the history of ICL from its origins in punch card technology to its demise in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Origins in Punch Card Technology

The story of ICL begins with the invention of the electromechanical tabulating machine for punched cards by Herman Hollerith in the 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Hollerith developed this machine for the 1890 U.S. census, realizing that manual counting would take 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This tabulating machine, influenced by cash registers and typewriters, revolutionized the sector as the first of its kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine Company of New York (TMC) to sell his invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Later, he sold TMC to the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), which was renamed [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | International Business Machines (IBM)]] in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Punch Card Technology Overview

Punch cards were used for data input, output, and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Early Hollerith machines primarily read and summarized data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. By the 1920s, these machines could perform basic mathematical operations like multiplication and division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. They were highly useful for businesses, for instance, managing magazine subscriptions by sorting customer data faster than manual methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While paper cards were relatively durable, they could bend and break, causing input delays, and their storage space was limited; a two-inch stack of IBM punch cards held about 40,640 bytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Fundamentally, these were calculating machines that collated, processed, and stored data, but did not run programs or host applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### The British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM)

In 1907, Hollerith's British acquaintances, R. P. Porter and Sir Raleigh Philpotts, licensed his technology to found the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Hollerith granted BTM an exclusive license for punch card technology across the British Empire (excluding Canada) in exchange for 25% of their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This license was later inherited by [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

BTM's first automatic tabulator, available in 1908, processed about 150 cards per minute and quickly sold to large organizations like railways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The 1911 census of England, Wales, and Scotland used punch card technology, significantly popularizing its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Competition and Relationship with IBM

In the 1920s, [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] and BTM collaborated against their main competitor, Power-Samas, a French-American conglomerate that produced the Powers machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Despite access to IBM's superior products, R&D, and manufacturing, BTM struggled to match IBM's sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. While IBM dominated the U.S. market with 90% share, the British Empire market was evenly split between Power-Samas and BTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

IBM executive Thomas Watson criticized BTM's "low-key and typically British" sales style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, while BTM blamed the restrictive 25% royalty rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The relationship between the two companies' leaders was strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

In the 1930s, both Power-Samas and BTM began designing their own machines due to a "Buy British" movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. By the outbreak of World War II, BTM had about 1,200 employees, smaller than IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. During the war, both British punch card firms halted R&D, turning their facilities over to the UK government to produce military equipment like bomber aircraft frames and gun aimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Transition to Computers and Early British Players

After World War II, the industry recognized that the future lay in electronics and stored-program computers, rendering the punch card industry obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. At the time, computers were seen as expensive, niche devices, costing over a million dollars and being the size of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Companies like [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] initially adopted a cautious "evolution not revolution" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, integrating electronic aspects into existing product lines.

IBM's first electronic calculator, the IBM 603 (1946), could read 6,000 cards an hour and perform quick calculations, selling hundreds of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. In 1948, the IBM 604 Electronic Calculating Punch offered programming steps, albeit limited by the physical insertion and removal of punch cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The IBM 604 sold exceptionally well, with over 400 still in use in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### The IBM-BTM Breakup and Government Intervention

1949 was a pivotal year for the [[rise_and_fall_of_british_computing_industry | British computing industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] and BTM mutually ended their long-standing sales agreement, entering open competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. BTM lost access to IBM's products and R&D but no longer had to pay the 25% royalty rate, which tripled its operating profit, allowing investment in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. While BTM (with £5 million revenue) was significantly smaller than IBM ($400 million USD revenue), it held a belief in [[rise_and_fall_of_british_computing_industry | British skill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The license had been unique, with no end date and access to IBM products at cost plus 10%, keeping IBM out of British territories for half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Concerned about the UK's ability to exploit its innovations, the Labor government founded the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. NRDC's goal was to develop and secure rights to the UK's public research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Lord Halsbury, NRDC's first general manager, visited IBM in 1949 and was convinced that punch cards would soon be in museums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. He believed the [[rise_and_fall_of_british_computing_industry | British computing industry]] couldn't compete with the American giant and urged British businesses to enter the computing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Early British Computer Firms

With [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] and its punch card affiliates hesitant about the computing revolution, a few British companies ventured into the space:
*   **Ferranti:** A British electronics manufacturer founded in 1883, partnered with Manchester University to build a commercial computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The Ferranti Mark One computer was installed in February 1951, just four months before UNIVAC I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Elliott Brothers:** An older British firm that, in 1947, produced a stored-program computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. In 1953, Elliott Brothers became the second British firm to install a commercial computer, though their product was low-powered and limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. They later focused on niche low-power process computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **English Electric:** Founded after World War I, this diversified manufacturer expanded into computers, working with the National Physical Laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Ferranti and Elliott were the primary British firms pursuing commercial computers with speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. However, they were not in a position to compete with American giants like GE, RCA, and Honeywell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. The perception that computers had significant commercial potential only shifted in the mid-1950s, when [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] finally entered the computer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### IBM's Mass Production and BTM's Hesitation

In 1955, [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] introduced the IBM 650, the world's first mass-produced computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This general-purpose computer was popular and the first to make a profit in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Despite its success, IBM only shipped two such computers to the British Isles throughout the 1950s, leaving an opportunity for domestic players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

BTM, having built R&D capacity and produced its own computer (the Hollerith Electric Computer or HEC One) with the University of London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, had the most potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. However, throughout the 1950s, BTM showed little interest in computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Even with the HEC4 machine released in 1956, 90% of BTM's revenue still came from profitable punch card machines, mainly for accounting departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## The Formation of ICT and the Transistor Revolution

As the 1950s ended, BTM faced a significant challenge from [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] in its export markets (Australia, South Africa, India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Power-Samas was weakened by competition, leading BTM to merge with them in 1959, forming International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The merger, however, created a "massive headache" for BTM management, as integrating Power-Samas's mechanically-minded R&D department cost years of progress that could have been used for electronic computing upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

ICT, with 17,000 employees, aimed to allocate half of its R&D spend to computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. However, in 1956, [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] introduced the IBM 1401, a revolutionary computer that replaced vacuum tubes with transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The 1401 was cheaper, faster, more reliable, and came with an ecosystem of enterprise hardware, peripherals, and application software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. It targeted the core use case of the punch card industry as a complete data processing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The IBM 1401 sold over 10,000 units and became IBM's most important product by 1962, effectively obsoleting all first-generation vacuum tube computers, including those in Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

### Consolidation and the "Software Crisis"

The transistor revolution forced British companies to decide whether to bulk up to challenge [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] or withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. English Electric and Elliott Automation remained, though Elliott focused on niche areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Others like Ferranti and GE exited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. English Electric and ICT acquired the assets and employees of these dropouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>:
*   **ICT** acquired computer interests from GEC (1961), EMI (1962), and Ferranti (1963), gaining the key Canadian-made Ferranti Packard 6000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   **English Electric** purchased computer interests from Leo Computers (1963) and Marconi (1964) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

By 1964, the [[rise_and_fall_of_british_computing_industry | British computing industry]] was essentially English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. However, this wave of consolidation led to "indigestion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Unlike Japan's successful auto industry mergers, these computer mergers were haphazard, resulting in a "massive mess" due to differing engineering approaches, techniques, and system administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. ICT, for instance, produced too many incompatible computer products, none of which were good except the Ferranti Packard 6000, creating a significant technology gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

The transistor revolution also brought about a "software crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Each hardware upgrade required new software, causing software costs to sometimes surpass hardware costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] responded by investing $500 million to develop the System/360 in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. The System/360 was a family of computers (6 processors, 40 peripherals) designed to replace all previous IBM products with a single, scalable architecture, allowing customers to upgrade hardware without rewriting software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. This "third generation" system caught the entire industry by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

ICT had planned a family of computers for 1968 but accelerated its release, reworking the Ferranti Packard 6000 into the ICT 1900 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. It sold well due to an IBM production delay in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. English Electric licensed RCA's computer architecture, compatible with IBM System/360, releasing the System 4 in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. While System 4 sold well to prestige customers, its reliance on U.S. R&D caused unrest within the British political class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

## Government-Mandated Merger: The Birth of ICL

In October 1964, the Harold Wilson government established the Ministry of Technology (Mintech), with a primary focus on the [[rise_and_fall_of_british_computing_industry | British computer industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Mintech aimed to consolidate the industry to compete with American giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This concern was amplified by events like General Electric's purchase of France's Bull and the USA denying export licenses for computers to France, preventing its H-bomb development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Other European countries' "Plan Calcul" initiatives to create national champions against [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] generally failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

The UK was one of the last European strongholds where [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] didn't dominate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Mintech sought to merge English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Initial talks in 1964 failed as both companies felt strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. However, after the 1966 re-election, the Wilson government pursued its vision aggressively, offering a £30 million dowry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. By this time, ICT was doing well, while English Electric found the System 4 development costs onerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

The two firms agreed to merge in 1967, but financial arrangement delays and the worsening UK economy in 1968 (leading to devaluation of the British pound) reduced the dowry to £13.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Regardless, the merger finalized in July 1968, creating International Computers Limited (ICL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. ICL generated £100 million in annual revenue, employed 34,000 people, and was the world's largest non-American computer manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

## ICL's Struggle and Eventual Decline

ICL's mission was to rationalize its computer range, boost R&D, and compete with [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. It inherited two incompatible mainframe product families: the 1900 series from ICT and the System 4 from English Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Although the 1900 series was technically outdated, political pressure from the Labor government prevented its phase-out, as System 4 was not "British made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

ICL focused on selling high-end mainframe computers to prestige clients, often through political interference, which ironically hastened its marginalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. This over-emphasis on the expensive mainframe industry caused ICL to miss the minicomputer boom of the 1990s, a trend that would also impact [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

The computer industry's first recession in 1968 forced General Electric and RCA out of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. ICL sought government intervention and aid, but the newly elected Conservative government under Edward Heath (1970) was anti-interventionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Despite this stance, the government had to rescue Rolls-Royce in 1971, leading to criticism given France and Germany's significant government support for their computer industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

ICL laid off 3,000 workers and cut R&D spending in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Ultimately, ICL received a £40 million government loan, which maintained R&D from 1972 to 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. However, it became clear ICL couldn't afford the heavy R&D costs to remain competitive in the British mainframe industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Annual R&D spend rose by 50% from 1974 to 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Two costs were particularly heavy:
*   **Software Development:** Over a third of ICL's R&D budget was for writing new operating systems for every new architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **Semiconductor Production Cycles:** Tightening cycles meant new products had to be released much faster, a pace ICL couldn't match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

Despite these challenges, ICL successfully entered the small business space with the 1976 acquisition of Singer Business Machines and its System 10 computers, contributing positively to revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. Still, the focus remained on the lagging mainframe business, leading ICL to seek a collaborator with strong technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

## Partnership with Fujitsu and Final Demise

Fujitsu was one of several Japanese computer companies challenging [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. Fujitsu partnered with Amdahl Corporation to release advanced computers with superior semiconductor technologies, achieving technical parity with IBM's highest-end mainframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. By 1980, Fujitsu was one of IBM's few real competitors and the only company to outsell IBM in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. IBM responded by accelerating its semiconductor production cycle, replacing its System/360 and 370 machines with the IBM-4300 series, which offered a four-times improvement in cost-performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>.

ICL, whose technology was once only three years behind [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]], found itself caught in this intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. Initial estimates in 1978 projected that annual R&D spend would need to nearly triple to £89 million by 1983 to maintain market competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

The 1980 economic recession further exacerbated ICL's problems, with projected losses of £50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. ICL management sought more government assistance, but the newly elected Thatcher government was reluctant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. A £200 million loan guarantee was eventually granted, but it came with the condition of replacing the management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. Even with the loan, ICL cut 10,000 jobs from 1980 to 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

To manage skyrocketing R&D costs, particularly in semiconductors, ICL sought partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. American companies could offer 3,000 logic gates on a chip, better than ICL's 1,000, but Fujitsu offered 5,000 gates and promised a five-year roadmap for future chip designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

In 1981, ICL struck a technology transfer deal with Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. ICL transferred peripheral technologies (disks, tapes) to Fujitsu and would sell Fujitsu's IBM-compatible mainframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. In return, ICL gained access to Fujitsu's advanced semiconductor technology, which turned out to be even more advanced than initially shown (8,000 gates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. Two processors, a medium and a small one, entered the market as the Series 39 in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

By 1985, ICL had already been taken over by British telecommunications firm Standard Telephone and Cables (STC) in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. The 1981 government rescue and the Fujitsu partnership marked the end of ICL's hopes of being a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. The company slashed R&D, partnered with external vendors, closed manufacturing plants, and focused on sales and systems integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. ICL evolved into a simple assembler and distributor, sourcing cheapest components and selling them to existing clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. ICL continued to generate profits (50% gross margins) and even contributed the majority of STC's profits after STC faced its own financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

In 1990, Fujitsu acquired ICL, causing a "minor shock" to the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. Fujitsu initially promised to float the brand but shut it down completely after 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

## Lessons from ICL's Downfall

The downfall of ICL illustrates several common trends in the [[rise_and_fall_of_british_computing_industry | computing industry]]:
*   **Lack of Technical Primacy:** The British industry consistently followed [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] and Japanese giants, failing to achieve business leadership in its geographic domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Splintering of the Industry:** The computer industry, contrary to predictions of massive vertically integrated combines like telecom, splintered due to competitive intensity and market size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. Individual companies emerged focusing on niche products like software, raising the stakes to a point where integrated combines could not keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. ICL could not invest in operating systems and applications as much as a company like Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Hollowness of National Prestige:** ICL and its political sponsors aimed to beat [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] in its strongest area – big, bulky mainframe computers – investing to emulate IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. However, this national champion lacked the resources and ultimately faced the same market circumstances that led to IBM's decline in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.
