On the morning of February 17, 1979, the People's Republic of China began shelling the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, followed shortly by 100,000 PLA troops crossing the border [00:00:00]. Five columns of troops swept through border areas, capturing several cities [00:00:14]. This military invasion was the culmination of a series of aggravating offenses and disputes that escalated into open conflict [01:03:00].

Despite shared Marxist ideologies and historical comradeship, the Chinese attacked their ally [00:00:18]. Ho Chi Minh had consistently referred to China and Vietnam as "comrades and brothers" [00:00:26], and China played a crucial role in assisting Vietnam against the French and Americans [00:00:33]. Traditionally, Marxist allies were expected to resolve disputes through theoretical arguments, not military force [00:00:45].

## Background and Causes

### [[historical_tensions_between_china_and_vietnam | Historical Tensions]]
The relationship between Vietnam and China has been complex and conflicted for centuries [01:18:00]. This history includes nearly 1,000 years of colonization and a 20-year invasion by the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century [01:27:00]. The Vietnamese often viewed Chinese intentions with suspicion, seeing themselves as treated like a "junior partner" rather than equals, which caused resentment when they sought to act independently [01:45:00].

### Post-Vietnam War Strains
The divide between the Vietnamese and Chinese widened after the Vietnamese Communist Party reunified the country at the end of the Vietnam War [01:08:00]. While China provided nearly $20 billion in aid and resources to Vietnam during the war against the United States [01:57:00], this assistance came with a condition: Vietnam was not to accept aid from the Soviets [02:09:00]. The Chinese, in turn, were angered by what they perceived as Hanoi's lack of gratitude for this aid [02:17:00].

Further escalating tensions were ongoing border clashes and the expulsion of ethnic Chinese individuals from Vietnam [02:28:00]. China's leader, Deng Xiaoping, felt that the Vietnamese had become "too big for their britches" and needed a "lesson for their insolence" [02:36:00]. This sentiment seemingly reinforced the Vietnamese belief that China would perpetually treat them as an inferior partner [02:41:00].

Adding to the strained relationship was the Chinese Communist Party's desire to improve relations with the West and distance itself further from the Soviet Union [02:50:00]. At this time, the Party considered the Soviet Union its primary foreign policy threat [03:11:00]. The [[sinosoviet_nuclear_cooperation_and_its_challenges | Sino-Soviet Split]], which began with disputes between Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev over Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin, had been ongoing for a long time [03:17:00]. Despite occasional Soviet attempts at thawing relations, China distrusted the USSR due to its continued military buildup and exercises along the Soviet-Chinese borders [03:29:00].

In July 1977, Deng Xiaoping emerged as China's paramount leader, holding key positions within the Communist Party, Central Military Commission, and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) [03:42:00]. He seized power from Hua Guofeng, Mao Zedong's appointed successor, in a pivotal November 1976 meeting where Chen Yun, an economic czar and Deng's confidant, criticized the excesses of the Cultural Revolution [03:59:00]. Deng's rise marked a shift away from ultra-left ideology towards a more moderate agenda focused on economic modernization and opening to the outside world [04:31:00]. This meant cultivating warmer relations with the United States, which was seen as the global leader in technology and ideas [04:43:00]. Invading Vietnam could be perceived by the international community as a serious indicator of China's commitment to this new foreign policy direction and as proof that China's military could competently fight alongside Western powers against Soviet influence [04:55:00].

Deng Xiaoping almost single-handedly orchestrated the war effort against Vietnam, driven by what might be described as an irrational grudge against the Vietnamese [05:25:00]. As the paramount leader, his decisions were unchallenged, leading to the war's progression [05:30:00].

### Strategic Directives
Deng specifically ordered the PLA to limit the war's scope to achieve China's political goals [05:42:00]. This approach aimed to prevent China from becoming bogged down in Vietnam, similar to the American experience, and crucially, to deter Soviet intervention [05:54:00].

The war was planned in two stages:
*   **First Stage (February 17-25):** A two-pronged offensive, with one prong targeting Cao Bang and Lao Cai, and the other simultaneously hitting Dong Dang [06:03:00].
*   **Second Stage (February 26-March 5):** PLA forces would converge on Lang Son [06:18:00].

Upon completion of these stages, the Chinese army would withdraw and claim victory [06:27:00]. Approximately 330,000 PLA men were allocated for the largely land-based attack [06:34:00].

### Pre-War Preparations and Miscalculations
The Vietnamese high command was surprised by the PLA's attack [06:41:00], despite a Chinese propaganda campaign labeling the Vietnamese as "dogs of the Soviet Union" and the "Cuba of the East" [06:45:00]. A significant sign of imminent attack was the evacuation of 300,000 civilians from Heilongjiang and Xinjiang, areas bordering the Soviet Union, to guard against a potential Soviet counterattack [06:53:00].

Most of Vietnam's regular troops were deployed in Cambodia suppressing a military action [07:10:00]. This left approximately 150,000 regional security and militia forces to defend against the PLA [07:23:00]. Chinese Central Command, however, seemingly ignored these militias in their assessments, assuming an overwhelming 8:1 advantage over the Vietnamese [07:30:00]. This miscalculation proved costly, as the Vietnamese local forces were well-trained and well-equipped, making the actual advantage closer to 2:1 and inadequate for conquering a province with local popular support [07:41:00].

### Invasion and Progress
On February 17, 1979, at 5 AM, artillery barrages commenced along the Sino-Vietnamese border, followed by 100,000 soldiers and tank units advancing [08:04:00]. Their primary objectives were Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Lao Cai, with Lao Cai being a crucial focal point due to its railroad to Hanoi [08:17:00].

Deng and Central Command restricted Chinese flying missions to Chinese airspace, meaning no air support for ground troops [08:28:00]. Furthermore, middle and lower-ranking officers were not permitted independent judgments or adjustments to conditions, forcing the PLA to send "waves and waves of human soldiers at a fortification" [08:33:00]. While this tactic achieved progress through "sheer force of numbers," it resulted in thousands of Chinese casualties [08:54:00].

The PLA advanced 10 miles into Vietnamese territory, capturing several border towns and pushing towards Lao Cai [08:58:00]. They also took two smaller towns en route to Dong Dang, where they encountered the Vietnamese "Flying Tiger Regiment" – their first regular army regiment [09:09:00].

By February 20, Beijing began to publicize the conflict, claiming "very heavy" losses inflicted on the Vietnamese, estimating 10,000 Vietnamese casualties compared to 2,000-3,000 Chinese casualties [09:22:00].

### Challenges for the PLA
The PLA soldiers quickly learned the difficulties of jungle warfare, as Americans had discovered after two decades in Vietnam [09:44:00]. The PLA was not well-trained for these conditions and suffered immense casualties from tunnel and jungle warfare, booby traps, land mines, and bamboo stakes [09:49:00]. The Vietnamese had fortified border provinces with tunnels, caves, and trenches, effectively utilized by their well-armed militia [10:00:00]. Rain further hampered operations, forcing PLA troops to use horses and donkeys for transport over muddy roads and rocky terrain [10:10:00]. Infantry soldiers tied themselves to tanks to avoid falling off, making them easy targets during ambushes [10:15:00]. Tank units suffered particularly heavy losses, with 87% experiencing some form of damage [10:25:00].

Despite these challenges, the PLA captured Lao Cai and Cao Bang [10:33:00]. On February 21 and 22, both sides reinforced their positions and converged on Lang Son, where the heaviest fighting occurred [10:43:00].

### Capture of Lang Son
Lang Son, located just 85 miles from Hanoi, is bordered by rugged mountains to the north and an open plain to the south [10:49:00]. Two PLA divisions approached the city from Dang Dong and Loc Binh, cutting off all roads [11:02:00]. Following Mao's strategy of first occupying the surrounding countryside to avoid getting bogged down [11:06:00], the PLA mostly surrounded Lang Son by March 2 [11:14:00]. Highways were littered with casualties from both sides [11:26:00].

On March 3, the PLA launched an attack to capture the remaining area to the south, the Khua Ma Son mountains, to complete the encirclement of Lang Son [11:33:00]. Tanks and infantry swarmed a fortified hill, capturing it in just 10 minutes [11:39:00]. They then destroyed adjacent Vietnamese artillery positions, completing the encirclement and capture of Lang Son [11:46:00].

### Conclusion and Withdrawal
From the outset, Deng and the Chinese high command emphasized that the war would be limited and short-lived, with the goal of keeping Vietnam "in line" [12:00:00]. By February 23, a week into the fighting, ambassadors and reporters were informed that the war would last "about another week," "about 10 days," or "a few days more" [12:11:00]. This public messaging was crucial to prevent the war from dragging on and involving larger powers, specifically the Soviet Union [12:26:00]. This strategy succeeded, as the Soviets ultimately refrained from intervening as long as the fighting remained "limited" [12:34:00].

On March 5, Beijing announced that they had "advanced 30 ... to 80 miles, taken the capitals of Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Lao Cai and 17 other countries and cities, and damaged severely 4 regular divisions and 10 regiments of the enemy forces" [12:43:00]. With the Party's political goals achieved, the PLA began its withdrawal [13:10:00]. The Vietnamese, for their part, chose not to escalate and allowed the retreat to proceed orderly [13:14:00].

The Communist Party's adherence to its word in limiting the conflict was notable, as army commanders or government hawks could have easily pushed for a larger engagement [13:18:00].

### Military Performance and Casualties
Deng's military strategies, similar to Mao's, focused on annihilating enemy forces, often through encirclement [13:44:00]. A major general in the war described the central leadership's instruction to "use a butcher's knife to kill a chick" – meaning to deliver sharp strikes to destroy vital enemy areas while avoiding their strengths [13:58:00]. However, the central command was willing to endure heavy losses when they believed a strategic advantage could be seized, pushing infantrymen into close massed combat even against well-fortified Vietnamese defenses [14:09:00].

Chinese army commanders frequently requested aerial bombing support, but Central Command's political restrictions on flights only over Chinese airspace meant the infantry was on its own, leading to immense casualties [14:37:00].

Casualty figures vary widely across sources. Beijing initially reported 20,000 Chinese killed or wounded during the three-week battle [14:54:00]. Hanoi claimed to have inflicted about 42,000 Chinese casualties [15:08:00]. Other estimates include 25,000 PLA killed and 37,000 wounded, or as low as 6,900 dead [15:17:00]. Regardless of the exact numbers, a significant number of Chinese soldiers perished [15:21:00]. In comparison, the United States suffered around 356,962 killed or wounded over 20 years in Vietnam [15:28:00], a number the PLA would have reached in about a year at its estimated rate [15:37:00].

Information regarding the PLA's performance in the war is scarce and often reliant on partisan sources or Chinese documents [15:43:00]. Even Party officials' internal documents acknowledged that the PLA underperformed operationally [15:55:00]. Army planners had arrogantly predicted taking Hanoi in just a week with a fraction of their forces [16:00:00]. In reality, it took 16 days and 10 full divisions to cover only a third of that distance, and they did not even face the proper Vietnamese army [16:06:00].

The PLA's weapons were outdated, tactics needed modernization from Mao's era, and morale was troublingly low [16:18:00]. The top-down command structure led soldiers to feel their lives were being wasted, with some units reportedly "forced" to advance [16:25:00].

### Party's View on War
While the PLA has significantly transformed since 1979, the Sino-Vietnamese War offers insight into how the Chinese Communist Party views war [16:42:00]. For the Party, war and the PLA serve as tools to achieve political goals [16:53:00]. If the Party achieves its objectives, the PLA is deemed successful, regardless of the army's tactical performance or the number of casualties [16:57:00]. This approach, reminiscent of the Red Army's tactics, implies that the Party's successful delivery of a message to Vietnam equated to the PLA's success [17:10:00].
