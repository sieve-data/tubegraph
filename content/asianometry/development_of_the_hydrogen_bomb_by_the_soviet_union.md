From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The hydrogen bomb is a staged thermonuclear weapon capable of terrifying amounts of destructive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The United States began developing the hydrogen bomb as a response to the first Soviet atomic bomb test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Remarkably, the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviets]] had their own H-bomb just three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While [[role_of_espionage_and_intelligence_in_nuclear_development | Soviet espionage]] was crucial for their first A-bomb, the path to their hydrogen bomb was "not quite" as straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Super

In September 1941, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi presented an idea to Hungarian-American physicist Edward Teller about using an atomic bomb to jump-start a deuterium weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This weapon would derive its energy from fusing hydrogen into helium, releasing a much larger explosion than fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. There are claims that a Japanese chemist, Tokutaro Hagiwara, first conceived this idea in May 1941, though later translations suggest he was referring to something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Teller became obsessed with this idea, pushing for its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A team at Los Alamos began discussing the theories in the summer of 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. At the time, the fission bomb was considered an "easy job," after which work could move to the "Super," as it was called, possibly finished before the war's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, the A-bomb proved more difficult, monopolizing resources for several years, while Teller largely worked on the "Super" on his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### The Concept

The initial concept was that neutrons and heat from a fission-based trigger bomb could initiate a nuclear fusion detonation in a mix of hydrogen isotopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This involved a gun-type fission bomb and a cylinder of deuterium, a plentiful form of hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. As deuterium atoms fuse, they release heat energy, propagating a chain reaction that could yield energy equivalent to a thousand fission bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The power could be arbitrarily scaled by adding more deuterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Classical Super Problems

Problems with the "Classical Super" concept quickly arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A pure deuterium-deuterium reaction required hundreds of millions of degrees, more than an A-bomb could generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Physicist Emil Konopinski suggested adding tritium, another hydrogen isotope, to facilitate the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Tritium, however, is much rarer than deuterium and must be produced in nuclear reactors, leading the team to seek ways around this supply problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. By the end of 1945, the team presented the Classical Super concept to colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Building the Super

After the United States dropped atomic weapons on Japan in August 1945, ending World War II, the US held a nuclear monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Despite the world seemingly being at peace, the idea of the Classical Super persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## [[role_of_espionage_and_intelligence_in_nuclear_development | Klaus Fuchs' Contribution]]

In the spring of 1946, Klaus Fuchs, a British scientist of German origin and an active participant in communist organizations since his youth, joined the project after working on atomic bomb detonation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Fuchs made improvements to the Classical Super concept, suggesting encasing the deuterium-tritium mix in radiation-impervious cladding to retain neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This early conception of "radiation implosion" was later patented with John von Neumann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

In June 1946, Fuchs left the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. It was later discovered he had passed critical information on the atomic bomb's design and construction to the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]], accelerating their atomic bomb progress by 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The question then was whether he also provided the keys to the hydrogen bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## [[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | Turning to the Soviets]]

In September 1945, [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet]] scientists began receiving intelligence reports about the Classical Super design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Several [[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | Soviet physicists]] were already exploring the idea, with one memo sent to Igor Kurchatov, scientific director of the nuclear program, detailing the concept of using atomic explosion heat to produce helium from hydrogen – "energy source of the stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Intelligence reports from the United States detailed the Classical Super design as it was in late 1945, including a Uranium gun-type atomic bomb trigger, deuterium and deuterium-tritium containers, Fermi's physics lectures, and tritium's role in reducing fusion threshold temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Support for a [[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | Soviet Super]] gained traction in October 1945 after the London Times reported Professor Marcus Oliphant's remarks on the possibility of a 2 megaton TNT-equivalent "superbomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. The [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviets]] questioned Niels Bohr about this "superbomb," who expressed skepticism about its feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Despite Bohr's doubts, the American intelligence reports motivated the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviets]] to pursue the idea, given their lagging atomic bomb technology and the US nuclear monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### The Possibility

Kurchatov assigned a working group led by Yakov Zeldovich to examine the hydrogen bomb's possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. In December 1945, their report, "Utilization of the nuclear energy of light elements," confirmed the feasibility of a nuclear fusion bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. New reports about American "superbomb" work continued throughout 1946 and 1947, augmented by press articles, including Edward Teller's 1947 Bulletin of Atomic Scientists piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

In September 1947, Fuchs, back in the UK, met a [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet]] intelligence officer, confirming the feasibility of a superbomb involving deuterium and tritium, though he was unsure if the Americans would build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Getting Serious

In November 1947, Zeldovich's group proposed propagating a massive shock wave through a mix of deuterium, tritium, and lithium, based on another intelligence report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The USSR Council of Ministers accepted this and established the Designing Bureau-11 (KB-11) in the secret town of Sarov, where Zeldovich and his team moved to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Shortly after, in March 1948, Fuchs passed detailed documents on the American superbomb design, including its radiation jacket, to his intelligence handler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. These documents were swiftly translated and sent to Stalin and Lavrenty Beria, head of the NKVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Alarmed by American progress, they pushed for accelerated development of alternative nuclear bomb designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. In April 1948, Beria sent the documents to Kurchatov and others for study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. A June 1948 resolution ordered KB-11 to conduct feasibility studies on a new type of hydrogen bomb, with Fuchs' design forming the basis for the "Tube" design or RDS-6t <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### [[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | The First Idea]]

Meanwhile, Kurchatov asked theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Igor Tamm at the Lebedev Physical Institute to check Zeldovich's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Tamm, who believed the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] needed nuclear weapons, recruited young physicists, including Andrei Sakharov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Tamm, Sakharov, and their colleagues disliked the Zeldovich design and began developing their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. By 1948, Sakharov had a promising design called the "First Idea," developed without access to Fuchs' superbomb documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The June 1948 resolution merged the Lebedev and KB-11 teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Layer Cake

Sakharov's design, eventually named RDS-6s, was called "Sloika" (Layer Cake) due to its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The bomb was a sphere about 1.5 meters wide and 4.5 tons, similar in size to the original [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet]] atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Inside were layers of highly enriched uranium and a thermonuclear fuel mix of Lithium Deuteride, Lithium Deuteride Tritide, and a Uranium tamper to maximize yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Chemical explosives compressed these layers, triggering fission explosions in the outer uranium layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

The inclusion of lithium deuteride came from Vitalii Ginzburg, who pointed out that neutrons bombarding the lithium could create more tritium, providing additional fuel for the fusion explosion – this was known as the "Second Idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The result was a large fission-fusion-fission explosion, approximately 80% fission and 20% fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Both Tamm and Zeldovich agreed that the Sloika design had the most potential compared to the Tube/RDS-6t and focused their efforts on building it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

This development occurred in 1948, before the first [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet]] atomic test in August 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Unlike in the United States, there was no debate about pursuing a bigger bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. After a brief break post-atomic test, [[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | Soviet scientists]] resumed work on their "hydrogen bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### Differences

The Layer Cake design, while harnessing nuclear fusion, derived most of its energy from fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. It could be called a "boosted" fission bomb, where thermonuclear reactions created neutrons that increased fission efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. In contrast, the proposed thermonuclear superbomb, the classical super concept, involved a fission bomb jumpstarting a much larger, two-stage thermonuclear explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

Oppenheimer was skeptical of the classical Super's technical feasibility, suggesting boosted fission weapons as a stopgap, while Teller advocated for full thermonuclear development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The first [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet]] atomic bomb test (RDS-1) in August 1949 ended the US nuclear monopoly and fueled doubts about predicting the speed of the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet]] nuclear program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Consequently, in January 1950, US President Truman ordered the accelerated development of the superbomb, a decision that made headlines globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### The Problem

The key challenge for a staged thermonuclear weapon was delivering enough energy to deuterium to trigger fusion before it dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. As Edward Teller's team worked on this, the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviets]] responded to Truman's order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Zeldovich and his team presented the RDS-6s design, authorized for prototype development by May 1952, with a test detonation planned for a month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This timeline proved ambitious, and the Layer Cake prototype explosion was delayed by a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

## The 1953 Test

The RDS-6s prototype was scheduled for August 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. In November 1952, the US detonated Ivy Mike, the first test of a staged thermonuclear device using the Teller-Ulam design, which solved the energy dissipation problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Ivy Mike yielded 10.4 megatons, but its 70-ton, two-story house size made it impractical as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

Despite Ivy Mike's impracticality, Beria and the government pressured [[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | Soviet scientists]] for a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Beria sent mathematicians as "replacements" to KB-11 and reportedly threatened the KGB General in charge of the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Days before the detonation, on August 8, 1953, Georgy Malenkov declared to the Supreme Soviet that the United States would not have a thermonuclear monopoly, intensifying the pressure on the scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

Four days later, Kurchatov initiated the countdown at the Semipalatinsk test site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. RDS-6s, called Joe-4 in the United States, was a successful detonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, tossing tanks like toys and leaving a 5-kilometer wide lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

### The Third Idea

[[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | Soviet scientists]] estimated RDS-6s had a yield of 400 kilotons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. While the US considered it a "boosted fission device" incapable of scaling to arbitrarily high yields like "true" thermonuclear devices, RDS-6s was small enough to be a practical weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. [[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | Soviet weapons designers]] initially believed they could scale Layer Cake to 1 or 2 megatons but hit practical limits for efficient use of uranium-235 and tritium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

At this time, a more compelling idea emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. While working on the Tube design (inspired by Fuchs' 1948 material), scientists discussed using compression to heat thermonuclear fuel to millions of degrees, triggering fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. This idea of compression came from Lab director Viktor Davidenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

In Spring 1954, several scientists independently realized that during an atomic explosion, the majority of released energy comes as X-rays, which could be used to do the compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. This "Sakharov's Third Idea" (though Sakharov was not the sole originator) aligned with the concepts behind the American Teller-Ulam hydrogen bomb design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. There is no indication that the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviets]] used US intelligence for this; it developed organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. Fuchs' design had radiation implosion concepts, but its significance was not recognized until later by either the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviets]] or Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

Work on the less efficient Layer Cake and Tube bombs was abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. The [[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | Soviet team]] crafted a physical design to implement radiation implosion, leading to the device called RDS-37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. The infrastructure and supply chain established for Layer Cake contributed to its rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

RDS-37 was detonated on November 22, 1955, with a yield of 1.6 megatons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. The [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] had achieved the hydrogen bomb and parity with the United States far faster than anticipated in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

It has been theorized that Ivy Mike's fallout helped guide the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviets]] to the Teller-Ulam design by revealing the presence of elements exposed to high numbers of neutrons via compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. However, subsequent reviews of contemporary archives suggest the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviets]] lacked the skill or technology for such radiological measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

What Ivy Mike and the subsequent 1954 Castle Bravo detonation did do was confirm to the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviets]] that such massive weapons were indeed possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Awareness that "something else" was going on was often enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

[[key_figures_and_scientific_contributions_to_the_soviet_hbomb_program | Soviet scientists]] express immense pride in closing the hydrogen bomb gap with the United States in only a few years, believing their work prevented a nuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This marked a new stage in the [[comparisons_between_soviet_and_american_nuclear_weapons_development | rivalry between the two superpowers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
