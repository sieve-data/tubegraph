The intense competition between [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] and Samsung, particularly in the advanced semiconductor foundry business, was significantly shaped by the career trajectory and defection of semiconductor engineer Liang Mong-song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. His unparalleled technical brilliance and challenging personality deeply impacted both companies, driving periods of rapid advancement and fierce market contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Liang Mong-song's Early Career at TSMC

Liang Mong-song, considered one of [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s "founding geniuses," joined the company's R&D department in 1992 at the age of 40, after more than a decade at AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. He was a specialist in FinFET technology, a crucial element in future chip designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Liang was part of a group of brilliant semiconductor minds, including his former supervisor Professor Hu Ten-ming (who would later help bring FinFET to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>), Chiang Chang-yi, Rick Tsai, and Douglas Yu, who returned from the United States to contribute their talents to Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The most famous of these American migrants was Morris Chang, the founder of [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### Key Contributions at TSMC

One of Liang's most significant contributions was in the development of copper interconnects. While [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | IBM]] had invented copper interconnects in 1997, their technology struggled to move beyond the laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. In the early 2000s, [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | IBM]] offered to license its technology to [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. However, [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s R&D team, recognizing copper as the future but finding [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | IBM]]'s implementation insufficient, rejected the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Instead, a team of six elite scientists, led by Liang, developed their own 130-nanometer process node with copper interconnects, shipping wafers by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This critical achievement allowed [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] to surpass [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | IBM]] in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Liang was among the three men awarded the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker award by the Taiwan government for this innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

Despite his brilliance, named on nearly 500 [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] patents and receiving over $21 million in compensation, Liang was known for his stubborn nature and frequent clashes with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## The "Game of Thrones" and Defection

In 2005, Morris Chang retired as [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] CEO, appointing Rick Tsai as his successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. This triggered a management reshuffle where Liang, aspiring to a senior R&D VP position, was passed over in favor of Jack Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. Liang was instead transferred to a new initiative focused on "beyond more" or "more than more" – expanding [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s trailing edge foundry capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. This move, seen by Liang as a "banishment" due to his obsession with leading-edge technology, fueled his resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

In February 2009, Liang resigned from [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] after 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. His resignation agreement included a two-year non-compete clause, enforced by "golden handcuffs" withholding a significant portion of his financial payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. Liang initially stated he would teach at a Taiwanese university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. However, in October 2010, six months into his non-compete, he took a visiting scholar position at Songkun Kwan University in Korea, an institution with close ties to Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

On July 2011, two months after his non-compete expired, Liang officially joined Samsung as Executive Vice President of Samsung Foundry and Technical Director of Samsung LSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. He brought with him a team of 10 to 20 former [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

## Samsung's Ascendancy and TSMC's Response

Starting in 2009, around the time of Liang's departure from [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]], Samsung began to rapidly close the gap in process node technology, moving from 45nm to 28nm in just two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. When Liang arrived, Samsung was attempting to move to 20nm. Liang promptly pushed Samsung to directly jump from 28nm to 14nm, adopting FinFET technology simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. This ambitious multi-generational leap, driven by Liang's desire to surpass his former employer, enabled Samsung to announce a 14nm process node in 2015, ahead of [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s 16nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.

This was a stunning development that challenged [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s near-monopoly in advanced semiconductor foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>. Samsung's first-mover advantage with FinFET allowed it to attract significant [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>:
*   **Qualcomm**: Announced a billion-dollar deal for Samsung to produce its high-end mobile chips, a contract previously held by [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.
*   **Apple**: [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s most valuable customer, which had begun working with [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] for its A8 chip in 2014, decided to split production of its A9 chip (for the iPhone 6s) between [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] and Samsung in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.

Morris Chang publicly admitted in January 2015 that [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] was "a bit behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.

### TSMC's Legal and R&D Counterattack

In response, [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] filed a lawsuit in Taiwan against Liang, alleging a breach of his non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. After an initial ruling in Liang's favor, [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] appealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. In the second trial, [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] presented evidence showing:
1.  Liang's lectures at Songkun Kwan University were for Samsung employees and took place on Samsung's campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.
2.  Samsung's 45nm, 32nm, and 28nm chips became technically very similar to [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s after 2009, differing from [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | IBM]]'s technology that Samsung had licensed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.
3.  Liang had used a Samsung email address as early as 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.

The court ruled in favor of [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]], a decision upheld by the Taiwan Supreme Court, mandating that Liang could not work for Samsung until after the end of 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

Concurrently, Morris Chang spurred a massive R&D effort within [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] to reclaim node leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. In 2015, Samsung encountered issues with their Apple A9 chips, with netizens reporting higher temperatures and potentially lower battery life compared to [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. This, combined with [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]]'s renewed R&D focus, led to Apple making its next chip, the A10, a [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] exclusive, a partnership that has continued since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] subsequently regained leadership at the 10nm, 7nm, and 5nm process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>.

## Aftermath

As of this writing, [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | TSMC]] remains the leading semiconductor foundry, with Samsung in second place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>. Liang Mong-song's journey continued to SMIC in 2017 after his Samsung contract ended, further demonstrating the movement of key talent in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>. His efforts at SMIC, including attempting to acquire EUV machines, were notably affected by the [[impact_of_us_export_bans_on_smic | US government blocking those efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

The saga of Liang Mong-song highlights that while multi-million dollar machines are crucial, the true competitive edge in the semiconductor industry lies in the people—the brilliant and driven individuals who make the impossible possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a>.
