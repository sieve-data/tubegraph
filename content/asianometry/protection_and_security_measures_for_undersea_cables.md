Undersea cables are the unheralded backbones of the global communications network, carrying gigabits of information [00:00:02]. Much of the hyper-connected world depends on these "low-tech" cables, which snake through a dangerous neighborhood [00:00:10]. Protecting them is critical, as they still carry the majority of the world's internet and telephone traffic despite the growth of services like SpaceX's StarLink [00:15:32].

## Early Protection Methods
The idea of leaving an unexposed copper cable at the bottom of the harsh sea seems unwise [00:00:25]. The first underwater experiments began in 1811 when German polymath Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring attempted to cross a river with a telegraph cable wrapped in rubber [00:00:31]. This failed because rubber is a water-absorbent vegetable protein, allowing water to reach the copper [00:00:47].

A few years later, in 1838, Irish physician and telegraph pioneer Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy developed a new method to prevent water leakage [00:00:54]. He wrapped the wire in rattan, a palm material, and then again with tar-covered yarn, successfully sealing the cable from river water [00:01:04].

In 1845, the Brett Brothers proposed laying a telegraph cable from Dover, England, to Calais, France [00:01:20]. They wrapped their half-inch thick telegraph cable in gutta-percha, an inert organic plastic from Malaysia, and laid it down in 1850 [00:01:28]. However, this cable, unprotected and weighed down by only a few lead bricks, did not perform well 54 meters under the sea [00:01:45]. It carried a few badly distorted telegraph signals before failing the next morning, reportedly cut by a French fisherman [00:01:56].

For their next attempt, railway engineer Thomas Russell Crampton devised a new scheme in 1851: wrapping the cable in steel wire [00:02:05]. This proved successful, performing well over the next few years [00:02:11]. Virtually every submarine cable since has generally followed this model: at the core, one or several copper wires wrapped in gutta-percha insulation, followed by a cushioning layer and Crampton's armoring steel wires [00:02:21]. The first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable, laid in 1866, featured three layers of gutta-percha over its 2,500 miles, using over 300 tons of the material [00:02:32]. Gutta-percha was eventually replaced by plastic polyethylene in the 1940s [00:02:47]. To deter bacteria in tropical waters from eating the gutta-percha, cable makers sometimes applied powdered silica or brass tape [00:02:58].

## Modern Cable Design
As communications technologies evolved, so did the cables [00:03:10]. Telegraph cables gave way to telephone cables, with repeaters added in the 1940s to boost signals [00:03:15]. In the 1980s, the introduction of optic fiber vastly upscaled data bandwidth [00:03:25]. Tweaks to the design were introduced to accommodate these changes and differing environments, though the main setup remains similar [00:03:36]. This evolution is part of [[modern_advancements_in_undersea_cable_technology]].

A number of cable variants exist in the industry, each designed for specific conditions:
*   **Lightweight Cables** The workhorse of the industry, these cables feature steel wires wound around them along with some polyethylene [00:03:47]. They are suited for shallow waters known to be safe and stable [00:03:56].
*   **Lightweight Protective Cables** These add more polyethylene and steel tape layers, primarily to combat animals and chafing [00:04:01].
*   **Single-Armored Cables** These are lightweight cables with a single layer of steel wire and polyethylene wrapping, providing extra protection when the risks of cable-cutting are greater [00:04:13].
*   **Double-Armored Cables** Featuring two armoring layers of galvanized steel wires around the exterior of a standard lightweight cable [00:04:26]. These "beefy" cables are deployed in shallow waters with high traffic or when the cable cannot be buried [00:04:36].

## Cable Installation and Maintenance
[[Challenges of subsea cable installation]] include the process of laying cables from a boat, which carries several thousand tons of cable in a cable tank [00:04:46]. The cable exits the tank and travels through a "cable highway" of rollers to the Linear Cable Engine, which performs the actual laying or retrieval [00:04:55]. These engines typically use sets of tires to handle the cable [00:05:11]. The cable is subject to intense tensions during this process, so operators check its quality for breaks and may power it up to test its integrity [00:05:18].

For long cables, repeater stations are added every 60 to 80 kilometers to amplify and restore the signal [00:05:31]. Connecting a piece of cable to another is known as "jointing" [00:05:42]. This delicate process involves preparing the cable ends, splicing them, and re-encapsulating them in polyethylene and armor to achieve 90% of the original strength [00:05:46].

## Protecting Cables from Hazards
Undersea cables are subject to a variety of [[environmental_and_human_hazards_to_undersea_cables]] including natural, animal, and human threats [00:06:05].

### Environmental Hazards
*   **Chafing and Corrosion** A substantial long-term natural hazard is chafing and corrosion [00:06:10]. Currents and waves can chafe the cable's exterior by rubbing it against rocks and gravel, removing its outer protective layers and exposing the core [00:06:15]. Corrosion is a similar situation, often induced by biological creatures [00:06:27]. In shallower waters, barnacles, shells, or sponges can cover the cable, fouling it [00:06:34]. In deeper waters, kelp and corals can do the same, potentially encasing the entire cable if the area is particularly good for coral growth [00:06:40].
*   **Landslides and Earthquakes** Underwater landslides, unseen by humans, can easily cut undersea cables [00:06:50]. During a landslide, fast-moving, dense "turbidity currents" of water and sediment rush at up to 45 miles per hour, like an avalanche [00:06:58]. Landslides have plagued cables since the 1880s, with repair ships noting broken cables buried in fresh sediment [00:07:10]. A classic case occurred during the Grand Banks Earthquake of 1929, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake off the coast of Canada [00:07:26]. An hour later, a massive underwater landslide triggered by the quake moved over 175 cubic kilometers of sand and sediment, cutting eleven cables [00:07:37]. It is now cited as the textbook example of underwater landslide hazards [00:07:45]. Another notable incident involved a pair of magnitude 7.0 earthquakes off the southwest coast of Taiwan in 2006, which triggered several landslides that broke multiple cables, affecting communications in Taiwan and Southeast Asia [00:07:53]. Landslides are particularly problematic in delta areas where rivers dump large amounts of silt, biological material, and dirt into the ocean, forming "slumps" of loosely consolidated materials that break anything in their path when they move [00:08:13]. Earthquakes themselves can also take down cables; seismic movements can cause the seafloor to slide and reposition, breaking any cables traversing the moving seafloor [00:08:36]. The Grand Banks Earthquake alone cut 12 cables [00:08:46].

### Animal Hazards
Animals can break cables, often whales or sharks [00:08:54]. Whales, swimming deep for food, have gotten entangled in cables [00:08:57]. The theory is that a whale cruising with its mouth open could get its lower jaw caught in a loose cable, struggling to get free and potentially drowning [00:09:08]. Sharks biting cables are another famous, though rarer, culprit [00:09:27]. Biologists are unsure what attracts sharks to the cables, but proper reinforcement helps solve the problem [00:09:33].

### Human Hazards
Two-thirds of all cable breaks in depths under 200 meters are caused by humans: ship anchors and fishing nets [00:09:40].
*   **Ship Anchors** When a boat drops or retrieves its anchor, it drags [00:09:47]. If the anchor hits the cable and slides along it, it can cut the external armor and internal core [00:09:52].
*   **Fishing Nets**
    *   **Otter-trawl nets** These are large, cone-shaped nets towed by boats for catching bottom fish [00:10:02]. They use 1-ton hardwood "otterboards" reinforced with steel to keep the net's mouth open [00:10:08]. These boards can snag an unburied cable and damage it [00:10:14].
    *   **Beam trawls** These are cone-shaped bodies with a bag at the end, about 10 meters wide and weighing 4-5 tons [00:10:21]. They have "sliders" or "shoes" on the bottom that scrape across the ocean floor [00:10:31]. If a cable is exposed, the shoe can cut it [00:10:37]. In 2009, shoes were changed to a wing gear that floats over the seabed; while this didn't cut the cable entirely, it still sliced its insulation, exposing it to the elements [00:10:43].

Per the 1884 Cable Convention, the most widely known international law on cables, if a fisherman's anchors or nets get caught in a cable, they are obliged to sacrifice their equipment and report the incident to the cable owner [00:10:56]. In return, fishermen are entitled to an indemnity for their sacrificed equipment [00:11:11]. Fisherman anchors and nets are why undersea cable operators dig trenches for their cables or give them double armor in waters less than 1,500 meters deep [00:11:21]. Beyond that depth, the anchor hazard is less significant, so cables are often left on the ocean floor [00:11:32].

### Sabotage and Warfare
While most cable breaks are due to ordinary fishermen and shipping hazards, intentional cable cuts do occur [00:11:43].
*   **Theft** Many incidents are thefts for financial gain [00:11:51]. In March 2007, two vessels, one from Vietnam, removed 79 and 98 kilometers of cable from two Southeast Asian networks to sell the copper, damaging Vietnam's internet for three months [00:11:56]. This has also happened in Jamaica, Indonesia, and Egypt [00:12:10]. Most cables within a country's exclusive economic zone (200 miles from shore) are relatively safe, but outside of that, laws are murkier, and perpetrators may receive low fines or none at all [00:12:14].
*   **Asymmetrical Warfare** Cable cuts are also a measure of asymmetrical warfare [00:12:28]. Since they can interrupt communications for extended periods, cable cutting or control strategies are a critical focus of war planning [00:12:33]. For example, British control of the subsea cable network cut off the Central Powers of World War I from their overseas possessions [00:12:41]. In World War II, this forced the Axis powers to communicate via encrypted radio, opening the door to interception and decryption [00:12:48]. Recently, reports of cable cuts in the Red Sea have impacted internet speed [00:12:57]. Given how easy it is to cut a subsea cable—as simple as dropping an anchor and dragging it across the sea floor—and the high repair cost, such an attack is effective for asymmetrical warfare as it is easy to do and easy to deny deliberate intent [00:13:04].

## Protection Measures
The best way to protect a cable is to dig a deep trench, place the cable inside, and cover it [00:13:22]. This is challenging underwater, so modern methods use high-pressure water jets or underwater trenching machines [00:13:27]. The burial depth depends on conditions, with a general rule of thumb being no more than 2 meters [00:13:44]. However, if the seabed is particularly soft, deeper burial is needed [00:13:52]. In the late 1990s, fiber optic operators created a "Burial Protection Index" to gauge depth, but it is now considered outdated, leaving the decision to the integrator's risk assessment [00:13:57].

If the ground is too hard to cut through, alternatives exist [00:14:15]:
*   **Riprap (Rock Armor)** This involves laying smaller rocks on top of the cable, followed by larger rocks [00:14:20]. Riprap works best in areas with calm water currents to keep the rocks undisturbed [00:14:32].
*   **Cover Plates or Casing Pipes** These are shells that encase the cable [00:14:38]. Additional protections like riprap can then be layered on if necessary [00:14:44].

While the engineering for protecting these cables from natural hazards is quite good, a determined attacker can still cut a cable with ease [00:15:04]. Therefore, much of the security relies on obscuration, depth, and physical protections like trenches and riprap [00:15:15].
