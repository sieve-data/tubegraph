Australia's last major economic reform, the introduction of a consumption tax (GST), occurred in 2000 [00:00:16]. In the 25 years since, there have been no significant improvements to the system, despite a desperate need for them [00:00:22]. Over the past two decades, productivity growth has been stagnant or falling, which has slowed the growth of real GDP per person, a key measure of living standards [00:00:30]. This period of stagnation contrasts sharply with Australia's "golden era of economic reform" [00:01:09], which saw significant changes aided by technological advancements.

## Early Government Technology

Prior to widespread personal computing, government departments relied on labor-intensive processes.

### Typist Pools
When Ken Henry joined the Australian Treasury in 1984, typist pools were still in operation [00:02:53]. These involved groups of people who spent their entire working days typing documents and creating duplicates for filing purposes [00:03:10]. This was a common practice across all government departments [00:03:39].

### Punch Cards
In the early 1980s, during Ken Henry's academic years, most researchers, including himself, used punch cards for computing tasks [00:04:24]. These bundles of cards were fed into computers that had significantly less computing power than a modern mobile phone [00:04:27]. The process was slow; it could take an hour or two to receive output, and a coding error might mean waiting three days for another attempt to access the computer [00:04:47]. Ken Henry recalls taking a month to code a computable general equilibrium model using this method [00:05:07].

## The Dawn of Personal Computing

The introduction of spreadsheets dramatically transformed analytical work in government.

### Lotus 1-2-3
Ken Henry's first encounter with spreadsheets came in late 1984 when he joined the Treasury [00:04:08]. He witnessed a colleague using Lotus 1-2-3, a spreadsheet program with a black screen and green lines [00:06:17]. Impressed by its capabilities, he was able to build a computable general equilibrium model from scratch in about two hours on Lotus 1-2-3, a task that previously took him a month with punch cards [00:06:36]. He described being "blown away" by its power [00:06:45], and the Treasury extensively used Lotus 1-2-3 [00:06:48].

### Microsoft Excel
The Australian Treasury was reportedly the first user of Microsoft Excel in Canberra [00:07:08]. This adoption was driven by a project in the second half of 1991, mandated by then-Treasurer John Kerin, to develop a modeling capability for assessing changes to the indirect tax system and their distributional impacts [00:07:19]. The team was given six months to complete this task [00:07:53]. Ken Henry again found himself "blown away by the power of this thing" [00:08:27].

He recalled an instance where he attempted to invert a 107x107 matrix using Excel for an input-output model, which caused the program to crash [00:09:07]. Microsoft's response was that he was "crazy" for trying to invert such a large matrix, as an arbitrary limit had been placed on array size [00:09:35]. Despite this, Henry asserts that the introduction of a consumption tax in 2000 would have been "absolutely no way" possible without the capabilities provided by this software [00:10:04]. This illustrates the profound impact consumer software had on government operations [00:10:14].

## The Internet and its Impact on Government

The introduction of the internet brought new challenges and opportunities for government agencies.

### Initial Resistance
Initially, Treasury staff were unable to access the internet due to security concerns [00:11:14]. Ken Henry found this problematic, as policy-advising agencies like the Treasury have "a thirst for knowledge" and need to get information to impatient ministers "ASAP" [00:10:47].

### Long-term Impact
Despite early challenges, the internet is regarded as one of humanity's greatest inventions, providing phenomenal speed for accessing information [00:11:40].

### Evolving Dynamics between Ministers and Public Service
The internet, and more recently [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | artificial intelligence]], has changed the dynamic between ministers and the public service. Ministers now have the ability to perform their own research, akin to a patient Googling symptoms before visiting a GP [00:12:25]. This raises questions about how much ministers rely on their own digital inquiries versus seeking advice from their departments [00:13:08].

Ken Henry noted that different humans prefer to receive information in different forms—oral, graphic, or text [00:13:32]. Ministers, under time pressure, often prefer quick, easily digestible information that helps them formulate their public narratives [00:14:24]. An AI capable of tailoring advice to a minister's preferred communication style and public message would be "really powerful" [00:15:06].

## Future Implications of AI on Government

The advent of increasingly powerful [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] systems, including Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), poses fundamental questions for the structure of government and policy-making.

### Potential for Job Displacement
Ken Henry expressed deep concern about the potential for human-level [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] to automate away a significant percentage of public service jobs [00:29:16]. In the 1980s, 50% of the Australian Public Service (APS) was in the lowest two bands (APS 1, APS 2), a figure which has since dropped to about 5% largely due to technology automating tasks like those performed by typists [00:29:16]. While past technological advancements have generally made humans more productive without displacing them from the production process [00:32:26], current [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] developments suggest this "time limited" dynamic may change [00:33:18].

### Questioning the Need for Ministers
Ken Henry provocatively questioned whether there would even be a need for human ministers in a future dominated by powerful [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] [00:16:46]. He suggested that if [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] could perform all cognitive tasks, there might be no need for the judiciary and possibly even politicians or members of parliament [00:17:02]. He proposed that the only remaining human role might be a chief executive (like a Prime Minister) to whom an [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] assistant would report [00:18:00].

### The Role of Irrationality and Human Checks and Balances
A core problem for [[State capacity and government efficiency | governance]] in an [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]]-dominated future, according to Ken Henry, is the potential for [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] to always act rationally [00:19:51]. He provided an example of an [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] assistant refusing to support unsustainable policies (like repeated flood relief in a flood-prone area) because it would be "stupid" [00:19:20].

This highlights the importance of human "checks and balances" and the separation of powers [00:20:13]. Human leaders need to bear the responsibility for "morality and ethics" [00:21:25], which cannot be genuinely replicated or trusted in an [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]]. Humans also need "decentralization of advice and different perspectives" [00:20:44] and other humans to share the burden of responsibility [00:20:56].

### Policy Quality and Political Courage
Ken Henry suggested that increased speed in policy briefing due to [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] might not improve policy quality, but rather make politicians "even more cautious" [00:22:33]. He observed that "the more they know the less courageous they are" [00:22:49]. Political courage, he argued, is necessary to push through "hard stuff" and avoid playing a "small target strategy" [00:27:13].

### Economic Implications of Automation
The possibility of mass unemployment due to [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] raises critical questions about income distribution and the functioning of the economy [00:36:01]. Historically, technological advances have led to real wage increases and productivity growth [00:36:14]. However, [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] could mean that the production process no longer offers a secure form of income for most people [00:36:37].

This scenario would lead to a shrinking pool of people engaged in production and consumption, posing a significant challenge for existing economic structures [00:38:04]. The idea of large redistributive taxes to address this is met with skepticism, as taxing globally mobile [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] services would be difficult for countries like Australia [00:38:21].

## The End of the Reform Era

The period of ambitious economic reforms in Australia, from 1983 to 2000, has been followed by 25 years of comparatively "lackluster reform" [00:38:37].

### Explanations for Stagnation
Ken Henry identified several factors contributing to this decline:
*   **Complacency:** A significant factor is complacency, particularly linked to the narrative that mining underpins Australia's prosperity [00:43:56]. The "mining myth" has fostered a sense that current levels of prosperity are sustainable, despite declining productivity [00:44:02]. This contrasts with Australia's long-term historical trend of secular decline in terms of trade, which reversed dramatically in late 2002 [00:44:15].
*   **Lack of Political Ambition:** Ken Henry lamented a perceived decline in the "personal ambition of our political leaders" [00:45:07]. He cited Paul Keating, who sought to prove himself as national leadership material and achieve a global reputation as a "world's best treasurer" [00:45:13]. Similarly, John Howard pursued the GST reform to demonstrate his capabilities as a "reformist leader" after years of being a "frustrated reformer" [00:47:07]. Ken Henry argued that politicians who dismiss "legacy" as a "vanity project" [00:49:32] undermine the drive to undertake hard, necessary reforms.
*   **"Small Target Strategy" and Mandate Issues:** The political strategy of offering the "smallest target possible" to the electorate, combined with the idea that policies must have a pre-election mandate to be implemented, leads to "nothing" being done once in government [00:27:13].
*   **Lack of Courage:** There is a general waning of "the courage to be honest with the Australian people and to then come up with big ideas, sell the big ideas, then implement the big ideas" across Australian politics and beyond [00:28:45].
*   **Burning Platform:** Ken Henry believes that a "burning platform" — a manufactured or real sense of urgency or crisis — is "absolutely indispensable" for motivating sustained economic reform [02:02:07]. Without it, complacency prevents action. He suggests that political leaders have the ability to create this sense of urgency [02:01:46].

### Intergenerational Equity and Fiscal Drag
Ken Henry expressed significant concern about intergenerational equity, particularly regarding the tax system [00:54:00]. He advocates for indexing personal income tax scales to prevent "fiscal drag," where nominal wage increases push workers into higher tax brackets, reducing real wages while increasing their average tax rate [00:55:17]. This reliance on fiscal drag to balance the budget is a "very bad mindset" [00:58:26].

The aging population, coupled with favorable taxation of capital income and capital gains, creates a situation where younger generations, facing housing affordability crises and student debt, feel "robbed" [00:55:02]. Ken Henry himself had to help his children purchase homes despite their good jobs [00:59:42]. This issue was identified as early as 2002 in intergenerational reports, but "nothing's happened" [01:00:18].

## Innovation and Productivity Growth

Australia's productivity growth lags behind the US, generally sitting at around 80% of the US level [01:21:48].

### Limits to Productivity Growth
Ken Henry's research in the late 1990s suggested that Australia could realistically aim for about 95% of the US productivity level [01:22:21]. The remaining 5% gap was attributed to factors like Australia's geographic isolation and fragmentation [01:22:36]. He noted that "towing it up to sit adjacent to California" would lift productivity by at least 5% [01:22:48].

### Drivers of Productivity
Productivity growth is driven by two main factors:
1.  **Capital Deepening:** Augmenting labor with capital assistance (including [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]]) makes each hour of work more productive [01:24:21]. This requires a national investment rate matched to workforce growth [01:24:40]. Australia has experienced "capital shallowing" in the last decade due to a collapse in the [[Investment and future of technology | investment]] rate [01:25:01].
2.  **Multifactor Productivity (MFP):** This residual, often described as "the measure of our ignorance" [01:26:13], represents finding new, smarter ways of doing things (e.g., just-in-time production systems) [01:26:24].

Ken Henry prefers to focus on the drivers of capital deepening, asking why Australia's business [[Investment and future of technology | investment]] rate has been stuck at recession levels for a decade [01:27:16]. He believes Australia's "mining boom narrative" does not present an attractive picture for global capital deployment [01:28:29].

### Opportunities for Diversification
Despite challenges, Australia has opportunities for [[Investment and future of technology | investment]] and development in areas like:
*   **Critical Minerals Processing:** Australia has rich deposits of critical minerals but undertakes almost no processing [01:29:08]. While current processing can be "dirty," it presents a chemical engineering problem where Australia has "considerable expertise" [01:30:25].
*   **Engineered Wood Products:** Australia imports almost all engineered wood products, despite having a strong forestry sector. The industry is focused on exporting raw timber or pulp [01:31:16]. This is an area where Australia could develop domestic production for construction [01:32:02].

Ken Henry challenged the traditional economic view of "comparative advantage" based solely on existing factors of production (labor and capital), arguing that factors of production can be created, as demonstrated by Singapore [01:33:04]. He believes the Australian mindset of focusing on raw material extraction and export as its core strength limits industrial diversification [01:32:38].

## Population and Urban Planning

Australia's high population growth strategy, primarily through net migration, has led to second-order consequences, particularly for housing affordability, as this growth has been concentrated within existing major cities [01:02:05].

### Sustainable Population Debate
In 2007, when Australia's population was 22-23 million, Ken Henry estimated a sustainable population for Australia at 15 million [01:03:13]. He acknowledged, however, that a population of 50 million could be sustainable if accompanied by "pretty creative policy design" regarding where people would live and the necessary infrastructure [01:03:40].

### Building New Cities
Ken Henry proposed the radical idea of building entirely new cities, rather than continuing to concentrate growth in Sydney and Melbourne [01:05:40]. He suggested the possibility of building "a whole new city of 10 million people in a place that presently has nobody" [01:05:43], or even 10 cities of 1 million people along the Sydney to Melbourne corridor with high-speed rail links [01:08:18]. This approach contrasts with the current policy of high population growth within existing city footprints [01:08:53].

He cited Port Macquarie as an example of a city that experienced rapid growth (from almost nothing to 60,000 people in 40 years) by becoming a "100% services town" [01:10:56]. Its growth was triggered by the construction of a new hospital, which attracted health professionals and led to a boom in residential construction and ancillary services [01:12:16]. This demonstrated that a single, strategic investment in infrastructure could act as an "attractor" for population growth and economic development [01:14:40].

While acknowledging arguments for the benefits of larger cities, Ken Henry believes these benefits are "overstated" and that "congestion externalities" have been "undervalued" [02:08:51]. He suggests that enhanced well-being might come from less dense populations, provided the necessary infrastructure (schools, hospitals) is in place [02:10:01].

### Fertility Rates and Baby Bonus
Ken Henry was involved in the discussion around Australia's "baby bonus" policy, which aimed to increase the fertility rate [01:15:06]. His research suggested that the optimal population growth rate for minimizing the total dependency ratio (young and old dependents relative to the workforce) is the replacement rate (around 2.1) [01:15:52].

He was "shocked" that the baby bonus seemed to have an effect on fertility rates, demonstrating that "you can pay people to have babies" [01:19:01]. However, he noted that to achieve a total fertility rate above replacement, significantly more investment in support systems like childcare would be needed [01:19:32].

## Public Service Effectiveness

Ken Henry shared insights on what makes an effective senior public servant:
*   **Trust:** The paramount quality is being trusted, which is "a really, really hard thing to build and to retain" [02:13:01].
*   **Technical Expertise:** Trust requires technical expertise, as leaders need advisors who can answer complex questions on the spot [02:13:16]. Without this, public servants risk being replaced by [[Impact of artificial intelligence on government and labor | AI]] agents [02:14:19].
*   **Collaboration:** Effective public servants must be able to collaborate with colleagues in other government agencies [02:14:30]. Ken Henry actively promoted a Treasury persona of "helping" rather than being "Dr. No" to other departments' spending proposals [02:15:15].
*   **Team Leadership:** The ability to create and lead "highly effective teams of highly motivated people" who can meet "unrealistic demands" is crucial [02:15:55].
*   **Comfort with Ambiguity:** Senior public servants must be "comfortable with ambiguity" [02:16:33]. Losing this comfort can lead to burnout [02:16:39].

## Fiscal Responsibility

Ken Henry highlighted a significant fiscal problem in Australia, noting that the Charter of Budget Honesty Act has been "trashed by both sides of politics for a long time now" [00:51:15]. This abandonment of fiscal discipline, combined with global market disturbances, poses a "negative tail risk" to Australia's credit rating [00:51:38]. He believes there is a need to rebuild commitment to fiscal principles and transparency [00:53:02].

He also advocates for a comprehensive review of Commonwealth-State roles and responsibilities, starting with expenditure [02:04:51]. This is driven by the need to deliver "better outcomes for citizens" and address "deplorable" situations like inter-governmental blame during crises [02:05:06]. Such a review should lead to a "mature conversation" about allocating tax bases between different levels of government [02:06:17], particularly addressing "egregious" or "fragile" state taxes like stamp duties and insurance taxes [02:07:16].
