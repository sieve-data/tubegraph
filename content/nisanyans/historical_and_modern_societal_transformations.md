Societal transformations, both historical and modern, encompass shifts in political systems, demographics, cultural norms, and international relations. These changes often bring about new challenges and redefine established orders.

## Transformation of Law and Justice in Turkey

The sentencing of Selahattin Demirtaş and his friends to severe prison terms indicates a destruction of law and justice in Turkey, where the sense of justice, conscience, and decency has been radically undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The speaker asserts that there is no hope for positive change in the country, attributing this to the current government and its head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The existing balance of power in Turkey can only be changed through bloodshed, as political and legal means no longer offer a path for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## International Relations and Historical Narratives

### Armenia's Reconciliation Efforts

Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan's efforts towards reconciliation with Turkey and Azerbaijan are noted as significant steps for a country defeated in war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Despite false reports in the Turkish press, Pashinyan has not denied the Armenian Genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. His statements, aiming for reconciliation, suggest a need to move beyond dwelling on the genocide case for over 100 years and for Armenians to reflect on their own mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

The speaker highlights the surprising opposition to Pashinyan's reconciliation efforts from Armenian communities in California, New York, and Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. It is argued that Western states, particularly the United States since 1975, have actively kept the genocide issue alive, encouraging Armenians to focus solely on commemoration and lamentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Simultaneously, these same powers have encouraged Turkey's immoral denial of the genocide, especially since 1974 or 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Shifting Perceptions of Turkey

There was a stark change in the Western press's portrayal of Turkey. Until 1973 or 1974, articles in American and British media consistently praised Turkey, depicting its people as civilized, its women as modern, and its overall development as rapid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. However, after 1974, particularly after Ecevit came to power, Turkey began to be remembered as a "wild and evil barbaric country that has committed the greatest crimes in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This shift illustrates a manufactured narrative designed to serve political ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Modern Challenges to Democratic Processes

### The Role of NGOs

The current struggles in Georgia highlight a global problem: the co-option of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) by Western intelligence organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Initially emerging in the 1980s and 1990s as tools for democratic initiatives, NGOs have transformed into financially opaque structures that can spread like "cancer" through a country's politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Financed by entities like the European Union, NATO, and the United States, these numerous organizations make genuine democratic processes impossible due to their overwhelming financial power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

Georgia's government sought to address this by requiring foreign-funded organizations to register as foreign agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. The strong negative reaction from Western countries demonstrates a loss of traditional diplomatic decorum, with Western states openly engaging in "street fights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This open display of influence, while seemingly a show of power, is argued to be a sign of weakness from states that are losing their ability to operate within established legal and customary frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

### Political Alignments in Eastern Europe

Eastern Europe is witnessing significant political shifts. Hungary's incompatibility with the European Union has escalated into an open challenge, with the EU attacking Hungary with "pre-war" rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. Serbia has also taken a crucial step by signing a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. An unprecedented atmosphere of friendship has developed between Serbia and Hungary, marked by infrastructure projects like a high-speed train line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.

Slovakia, under Prime Minister Robert Fico, has aligned with this emerging bloc, taking steps such as vowing to veto Ukraine's NATO membership and preventing further arms shipments to Ukraine within the EU framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Slovakia also rejected the World Health Organization's international health treaty, seen as a step towards a "world dictatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. Following these moves, Robert Fico was shot, an event widely theorized to be orchestrated by Ukrainians or directly from Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. This indicates a dangerous escalation in global politics where traditional legal and diplomatic norms are abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

### Conflicts and Revolutions

New Caledonia is experiencing a "bloodbath" with severe clashes between the French administration and indigenous people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. The conflict is complex, challenging simple interpretations of colonialism and anti-colonialism. The indigenous Kanak people now represent less than 40% of the island's population, with the majority being settlers from France or India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. A French law facilitating migration and allowing long-term settlers to vote has effectively marginalized the native Caledonians, removing their control over the island's political future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

This situation raises a crucial dilemma: how to balance the rights of indigenous populations with those of later citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. This question is highly relevant in European countries like France, England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands, and even in Turkey, where traditional cultural groups may become a minority in number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. The question of whether these groups retain special rights over their country's fate is profound and difficult to answer neutrally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.

## Demographic Shifts and Identity in Turkey

Demographic trends in Turkey suggest a significant [[social_and_sociological_changes_in_turkey | societal change]]. The fertility rate of Turks has fallen significantly, raising concerns that Turks could become a minority in 10-15 years, especially in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. While the west of the country is losing population, the east, particularly Kurdish provinces, is experiencing rapid population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>. There is also an increasing presence of Arab populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This demographic shift is seen as the underlying cause of rising irrationality and panic among certain segments of Turkish society, leading to pessimistic outlooks on a peaceful resolution without bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.

## Historical Transformations of Political Systems in Turkey

### Critique of Kemalism

The Kemalist ideology and the political regime established in 1923 are described as fascist, taking a frontal stance against Kemalism and exposing its anti-imperialist claims as a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. Ibrahim Kaypakkaya is highlighted as a rare Turkish revolutionary who recognized the absurdity of claiming Kemalism and revolution in the same breath, earning respect for his clear stance against the state's tyrannical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. The true danger is seen not in Mustafa Kemal himself, but in the "Kemalism" as an ideology and the "Picture on the Wall" as a symbol of tyrannical state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

### The Republican Project and its Decline

The primary goal of the Turkish Republic regime (1923-1960) was to create a middle class: educated, literate, and familiar with modern world habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. The Ottoman Empire lacked a strong Muslim Turkish middle class, which was further decimated by compulsory military service from the 19th century onward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. Non-Muslims filled this gap, becoming doctors, lawyers, and various professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. The Republican regime succeeded to an extent in building a Turkish middle class, selecting and educating talented children to fill professional and civil servant roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.

However, the 1960 coup marked a turning point, ushering in "pathological Kemalism" and becoming a major trauma for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. Subsequent coups in 1971 and 1980 (the Kenan Evren dictatorship) further broke Turkey's back, delegitimizing intellectuals and turning Kemalism into a "state religion" and a tool of terror against independent thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>. Since 1960, Turkey has been in a spiral of collapse that is unlikely to be fixed without large-scale upheaval or bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

## International Order and "Foster Homelands"

The concept of a "foster homeland" (irredentism) refers to territories that a country considers its own due to historical ties but are under the responsibility of other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Historically, nations would conquer and annex such territories if given the chance, as seen with Hatay and Kars, Ardahan, Artvin, and Iğdır for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.

However, after 1945, the established world order made annexation by force the "biggest international crime," sacralizing existing borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. This led to situations like Northern Cyprus after Turkey's 1974 intervention, which remained a "daughter country" rather than being fully annexed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>. Similarly, Nagorno-Karabakh remained a de facto Armenian-ruled territory but not a formal part of Armenia for 30 years due to the international system's inability to change borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>.

The events in Ukraine are crucial because Russia officially annexed Donetsk and Luhansk provinces in 2022/2023, a significant deviation from the post-1945 norm of frozen conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>. This act "cracked" the two-faced international order, indicating that accumulated tensions on borders worldwide are likely to explode, leading to widespread turmoil as the "natural law of politics" reasserts itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.

## Governance Models in Islamic Civilization

Comparing Morocco and Egypt, the speaker explores whether monarchy can be a source of stability and prosperity in Islamic civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>. Morocco, with a continuous state tradition of 1000 years, is seen as more stable than Egypt, despite Egypt's richer natural resources and millennia-old state tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>.

Egypt's decline is attributed to leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser, who destroyed the country economically, socially, and institutionally through rhetoric and squandered wealth, leading to a state of dependency on foreign aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. In contrast, Morocco's undemocratic monarch derives legitimacy from ancestry, reducing the need to bribe the populace, allowing for long-term interests to be served <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>. This suggests that monarchies in Islamic countries (like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait) appear more successful compared to Arab countries attempting democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. However, monarchy cannot simply be "established" but requires generations to develop its legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

## Cultural and Religious Influences

### Iran's Influence on Islam

The [[cultural_and_societal_influences_in_history_and_modernday_politics | influence of Iran]] and Zoroastrianism on the formation of Islam is explored. While early Islam primarily drew its intellectual infrastructure, concepts, and stories from Christian and Jewish traditions (e.g., monotheism, prophets, holy books) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>, Zoroastrianism was in decline when Islam emerged and initially viewed as infidel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>.

However, later Iranian traditions are suggested to have significantly influenced the emergence of Sufism and Shiism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. More indirectly, Iran contributed two major concepts to world civilization:
1.  **The concept of Satan:** This idea, of an evil god with near-divine powers opposing a benevolent god, originated in Iranian culture during its first great expansion in the 6th century BC. It later passed into Judaism (during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah), then to Christianity, and finally to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>.
2.  **Organized, expansionist state religion:** With the rise of the Sassanids in the 3rd century AD, Zoroastrianism became the first actively propagated and spread state religion. This innovation prompted the Roman world to adopt Christianity as its own state religion in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.

### The Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul

The establishment of the Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul by Fatih Sultan Mehmet was not an act of modern human rights but a strategic political move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>. After the Byzantine exile of the Armenian patriarch in 1045, the Armenian Church faced centuries of chaos with rival patriarchates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. In 1444, a council in Kozan (Cilicia) attempted to unify the Armenian Church under a single patriarchate in Echmiadzin, near the capital of the Akkoyunlu state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>. This unification, under Akkoyunlu protection, was a significant geopolitical event that threatened regional political balances, as Armenians constituted a majority and powerful economic force east of the Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17">[01:31:17]</a>.

In response, the Mamluks encouraged a rival Armenian religious leader. Fatih Sultan Mehmet, anticipating conflict with the Akkoyunlular, established his own Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul around 1461, importing a man from Bursa to fill the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18">[01:33:18]</a>. This move served the Ottoman policy of "divide and rule," using the Armenian Patriarchate to counterbalance the Greek Patriarchate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>. At the time of its establishment, Armenians were a small minority in the Ottoman state, only gaining significant numbers after Ottoman conquests in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>.

### Evolution of Sacred Sites in Anatolia

Anatolia, including Çorum, is dotted with ancient tombs and sacred sites, many of which date back "unimaginably old times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:33">[01:37:33]</a>. These sites often transform over time, converting from pre-existing pagan or Christian pilgrimage places into Muslim tombs. A typical pattern involves a revered Christian site (church or monastery) falling into ruin, with locals continuing to visit the spot out of ancestral respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>. If perceived benefits or answered prayers occur, the site is then attributed to a powerful "teacher," and Muslims naturally translate this into their own worldview, transforming a Christian saint's tomb into a Muslim "Hoca's" or "Baba's" tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:17">[01:39:17]</a>. This highlights a continuous process of cultural and religious adaptation and reinterpretation of sacred spaces across millennia in Anatolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Personal Reflection on Change

The speaker reflects on personal transformation, noting that one always feels "careless" about their past actions if they strive for self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>. Observing old recordings, the speaker perceives a loss of eloquence since 2018, attributing it to an unspecified event in Samos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:55">[01:45:55]</a>. This personal reflection mirrors the broader themes of change and decline discussed in the context of societies and political systems.
