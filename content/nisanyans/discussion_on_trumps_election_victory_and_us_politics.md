A recent broadcast discussed the victory of [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] in the [[political_landscape_and_candidates_in_american_elections | American elections]] and its implications for US and global [[political_commentary_on_current_global_affairs | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The speaker initially admitted self-criticism, as they did not believe [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] would be "allowed" to win the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, anticipating interference through strikes, courts, or conspiracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This skepticism stemmed from a belief that the democratic process in the United States had deteriorated over the past 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, with governing cadres since 2001 adopting a "panic approach" where "all means are permissible for the sake of a political cause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Despite [[political_landscape_and_candidates_in_american_elections | Trump]]'s significant lead in polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, and perceived fraud in the 2020 election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, the speaker was surprised that election results were not contested or turned into a conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. It was suggested that efforts to "steal" the election were stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, indicating that an influential group within America's ruling cadres wanted [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, perhaps concluding that the departure of the current regime would not end well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Reasons for Trump's Victory

Several interconnected factors were identified as contributing to this significant shift in public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>:

*   **Economic Helplessness**: A large segment of American society feels a sense of helplessness due to an out-of-control economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Many have lost hope of buying houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Loss of Influence**: Citizens feel they no longer have influence in national administration, with decisions made by a "Washington elite that has lost its course and completely bypassed the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Major Crises**:
    *   **Covid Scandal**: The handling of the Covid crisis shook public trust in ruling cadres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
    *   **Ukraine War**: An unpopular war that the US government "embraced with all its arms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, allocating huge budgets but ultimately failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This led to a widespread feeling that the administration lacked strategic intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
    *   **Gaza Massacre**: The ongoing massacre in Gaza and Lebanon, and the government's perceived disregard for society's views on the issue, caused a "moral crisis" and outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Cultural Values**: There is significant outrage over the government challenging traditional societal values and imposing certain views on young children in schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

These factors combined to create a perception of a "morally rotten, incompetent, tyrannical and insensitive regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, leading people to support [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] as the apparent opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

## The Trump Coalition

[[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]]'s ascent to power was supported by an "interesting, very unexpected coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This included figures like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and J.D. Vance, who are leaders in the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Elon Musk's support, in particular, sparked "irrational reactions" due to the perception that he was "betraying his own class" of "university graduate liberal and Wok group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

The speaker questions the sustainability of this coalition, expressing distrust in [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. A friend's opinion was cited, suggesting [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] would "sell this entire team" if he concluded the "neocons" were too strong to be dealt with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. J.D. Vance was singled out as a "very impressive man" and a "quality man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a> who could be the next President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

A key point of discussion was the potential for conflict within this coalition, especially between Elon Musk and [[american_elections_and_trump | Donald Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. The speaker doubted that Elon Musk would have any significant power against the President, believing he would be "squashed like a fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

## Critique of the Neocon Establishment and its Impact

The speaker believes that the "neocon team" which "seized key positions in the American state" from 1997-98 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>, and effectively "seized power" with a "coup" in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>, has now suffered a "terrible defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. This team established the Ministry of Homeland Security and consolidated power through a series of wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. During [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]]'s first term, he was "turned into a puppet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. The speaker argues that the arrogance of this cadre, trying to govern like "ancient Roman Emperors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a> by putting forward "a senile old man" (Biden) and a "foolish woman" (Harris) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>, led to their downfall and loss of credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

This defeat is predicted to create a "tremendous chain reaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>, leading to the toppling of current ruling blocs in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. Examples given include the German government, which "raised the flag of bankruptcy" and is going to elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>, and the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a> and Macron's regime in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a> are not expected to last much longer. The speaker also mentioned that countless "propaganda officers disguised as journalists" and "non-governmental organizations" financed by the American state are expected to be "overthrown one by one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### Germany and Russia

Regarding Germany, the speaker discussed Maria Zakharova's statement describing Germany as a "banana republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, acknowledging "truth to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. The "most serious and important chess game" in the world is the potential for [[turkeys_political_power_dynamics_and_election_analysis | Russia]] and Germany to get closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

<div class="callout">
"[[turkeys_political_power_dynamics_and_election_analysis | Russia]] winning this war means winning Europe. Winning Europe is possible only if it wins Germany. America winning this war means NATO winning this war means NATO strongly protecting its integrity and unity and building a solid wall between Germany and [[turkeys_political_power_dynamics_and_election_analysis | Russia]]. This is the ultimate meaning and goal of the fight." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>
</div>

It is stated that Germany cannot get closer to [[turkeys_political_power_dynamics_and_election_analysis | Russia]] with its current "staff consisting entirely of American pawns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>. The potential rise of Sara Wagenknecht as Prime Minister of Germany and Sevim Dağdelen (a Turk) as her number two, both representing Germany's hope, was highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

### Ukraine War and NATO's Future

The speaker believes it's clear who won the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. NATO's strategy, having "invested all their assets and all their political capital" and strongly declared support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>, has condemned them to defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. The "smartest game" for NATO to minimize losses is to prolong the war and obscure its outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. Another possibility is to expand the war to new fronts like Poland, Estonia, and Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>, akin to gamblers who "continue to invest behind a wrong investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. It's hoped that [[american_elections_and_trump | Trump]] will not pursue war expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

### Potential War with Iran

Regarding the possibility of war with Iran, statements about destroying Afghanistan in a few days are dismissed as "empty bragging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. The speaker does not believe the alliance of the US and Israel can defeat Iran without using nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. Invading Iran or overthrowing its regime is seen as impossible for both the US and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. While Iran has "intolerable" regulations like the morality police, the regime has achieved significant improvements for the majority of its people since the Shah's era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>. The speaker predicts that if Iran were to collapse, [[turkeys_political_power_dynamics_and_election_analysis | Russia]] or China would not allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>. In an Israel-Iran war where the US intervenes, the probability of Iran winning is seen as 55-60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>.

## Critique of US Power Structures

The discussion extended to the nature of money and power in democratic societies. Money is described as a "symbolic asset" with no intrinsic value, its worth derived from "social consensus and social agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>. The increasing concern is that Central Banks have the authority to "distribute this artificially produced price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>, effectively directing money without oversight. It is argued that elected governments in "democratic" societies have "no authority regarding money," which is the "most important source of power and authority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a>. Similarly, elected governments have "no real authority" over military and armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>. Thus, the two most important dimensions of social governance – money and weapons – are managed by mechanisms "completely outside of control and independent of" democratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.
