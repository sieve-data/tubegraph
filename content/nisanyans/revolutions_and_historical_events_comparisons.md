This article explores various historical events and revolutions, drawing comparisons between them, examining their underlying causes, and analyzing their long-term implications.

## Turkish Political Traditions: Unionism and Kemalism

The historical relationship between Unionism and Kemalism is often debated. It is suggested that there isn't a "huge difference" between Unionism and Kemalism, and they are not considered "two different political traditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Instead, they are seen as two different eras, with one in the 1900s and the other in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Despite different emphasis and nuances, they are fundamentally the same political movement and ideological tendency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Unionism: Origins and Principles
Unionism is identified as the Young Turkish ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. It emerged from the Ottoman State's Muslim ruling classes who, since the early 19th century, faced the possibility of collapse and annihilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. By the time of Abdulhamid and Abdulaziz, a "psychology of defeat" had enveloped society, a feeling of slowly sinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

The extraordinarily oppressive and closed regime of Abdulhamid led to a lack of cadre renewal, resulting in a dominant, very old, and conservative cadre by 1908-1913/1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Young, educated cadres, long excluded from power, suddenly came to power in a "bang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, viewing themselves as a "cry for liberation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. By 1913-1914, most Muslim cadres in Turkey had united around this movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

The core principles of Unionism were:
*   **Muslim Identity**: A belief in existing as a Muslim society and ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   **Modernization from Europe**: Recognition of being left behind by Europe and the necessity to learn "secrets of this new civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. This included adopting technology, culture, arts, and military practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>, all to maintain existence as a Muslim ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Elimination of Non-Muslims**: The presence of non-Muslims in the country was seen as an obstacle to this project, leading to the conclusion that they "must destroy them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

### Kemalism: Continuation and Adaptation
After 1919, the same Unionist cadres, people, and organization came to power again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. The financial and organizational foundations of the national struggle were formed by the Unionists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

However, the new reality involved the loss of a large part of the empire and the absence of a non-Muslim population in the remaining areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. This meant the "cleaning of non-Muslims" was no longer an agenda item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Post-World War I, with Western states (England, France, US) as the "indisputable sovereigns," Turkey had to get along with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. The need to make peace, join the League of Nations, and "make forgotten" the "greatest crimes against humanity in modern history" (referring to the Armenian Genocide) necessitated good relations with Western states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This new atmosphere required continuing the same Unionist project in a new world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

Kemalism is described as a "forked-tongued" ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.
*   **For the masses**: The essence of Kemalism was presented as defending the homeland and nation against "seven powers," appealing to a Muslim nationalist identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. It was a "Muslim movement" based on "Muslim nationalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   **For Western elites**: An image and discourse of Westernization and secularism were presented to gain favor with Western states and the elites of Istanbul and Izmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. A secularism project also aimed to silence conservative segments within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

Kemalism is thus seen as a "locomotive that walks on two legs and walks on two rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>, combining "homeland, nation" with "modernity, secularism, Westernism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. The national education system predominantly emphasized "homeland, nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. Despite superficial differences, Kemalism's basis is the same as Unionism, fundamentally a continuation of the Ottoman imperial ideology adapted to modern conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. There was "no real rupture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.

### Contemporary Turkish Politics
The current political landscape in Turkey is assessed as a "complete authoritarian regime" since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:07]</a>. The "democracy era" is considered over and not likely to return soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:07">[16:07:07]</a>. State institutions, especially security institutions, have become "extraordinarily strong" and can easily make adjustments within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>. There is no longer an effective opposition party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.

The general direction of Turkey is seen as moving towards apoliticization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. This is because strong ideological feelings and thoughts are only possible in a democratic environment with intense party competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>. When there is no possibility of opposition winning, people "get tired of politics and move away from it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.

Both Islamist authoritarianism (AKP/Erdoğan line) and ethnic nationalist totalitarianism (Kemalist-Unionist alliance/nationalist Fascism) are discussed as potential future paths for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. However, it's argued that neither will fully dominate. Islamist ideology has entered a period of stagnation as its promises were "not very convincing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. The Unionist-Kemalist line is also internally divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>. Turkish society's "habit and tradition of pragmatism" means these ideologies won't fully resonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. Both are expected to be in a "downward trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.

Real power struggles occur within state institutions like the Army, Ministry of Interior, Intelligence Organization, and Foreign Affairs, the content of which is largely opaque to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>.

## Nature of Revolutions

A common misconception is that revolutions are started by organized parties with leaders, like a communist party with Lenin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>. However, historically, "none of the famous revolutions...have been like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>.

*   **[[french_revolution_and_related_movies | French Revolution]]**: Described as a "completely spontaneous, chaotic movement with no organizational logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32:00">[43:32:00]</a>. It "did not have an organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>.
*   **Russian Revolution (February 1917)**: Often misinterpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:42:00">[43:42:00]</a>. The real revolution happened in February 1917, not October, and was unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>. There was "not the slightest organizational incident in sight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:21:00">[44:21:00]</a>; it was a spontaneous uprising of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:33:00">[44:33:00]</a>. Lenin's October/November actions are considered a "coup d'etat," where a "brave cadre led by a tactical genius organized and seized power" after the state collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:13:00">[45:13:00]</a>.
*   **Iranian Revolution**: Occurred when five different elements "suddenly came together" and with the "uprising of the masses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:47:00">[45:47:00]</a>. Existing organizations like the Tudeh Party were "swept away by the revolution wave" and later liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00:00">[46:00:00]</a>.

> [!info] Rule on Revolutionary Organizations
> If there is a revolutionary organization, the probability of that revolutionary organization making a revolution is "very low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:30:00">[47:30:00]</a>. This is because state security forces (police, intelligence) are more powerful, have greater resources, and the law on their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:52:00">[47:52:00]</a>. Organizations also become burdened by routine, internal interests, and the need to protect themselves from infiltration, making them "terribly conservative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:59:00">[48:59:00]</a>. "If there is a revolutionary Party in that country there will be no Revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:23:00">[50:23:00]</a>.

Successful uprisings, characterized by "peasants arming themselves, going out to the fields," or "ministers deputies respected people being hunted down in the streets and lynched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33:00">[50:33:00]</a>, happen when "young and unemployed people get out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:08:00">[51:08:00]</a>. These are "young men in their 20s," seen as the "most dangerous class of all humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:19:00">[51:19:00]</a>, who are "prone to all kinds of savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:33:00">[51:33:00]</a>. Such movements destroy the state but "can't build anything in its place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:52:00">[51:52:00]</a>; a new government is then built from the ruins through struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:59:00">[51:59:00]</a>.

## [[political_and_historical_analysis_of_global_events | Political and Historical Analysis of Global Events]]

### Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict
Armenia suffered a heavy military defeat in Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020, with Azerbaijan nearly occupying the entire region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>. Russia intervened to cool the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>. It was understood by all involved governments (Armenian, Turkish, Russian, Azerbaijani) that this situation would continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>. After 2020, Armenia had "no way" to keep Nagorno-Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>.

The world did not rush to help Armenia because, since 1991, all countries (Russia, America, EU, Iran, etc.) recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as Azerbaijani territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>. Therefore, Azerbaijan's actions, while "inhumane" and "sauced with rhetoric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>, are considered a "domestic security operation in terms of International Law," similar to Turkey's actions in Dersim (1938) or Ağrı (1930) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>.

Armenia failed to solve the Nagorno-Karabakh issue on the international platform by not securing recognition for its historical and demographic rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>. A rational policy would have been to negotiate with Azerbaijan about the rights and security of Armenians within Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>. The deportation of approximately 20% of the Azeri population in Armenia in 1991 is seen as having "blocked the future of the Armenians" in Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>.

Internal Armenian politics saw "militant cadres of Upper Karabakh" taking over Armenian politics from 1991 until 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>. These cadres, including former leaders Kocharyan and Sargsyan, "managed to take Armenia captive for 30 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>, preventing necessary diplomatic steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:59:00">[32:59:00]</a>. A potential "small positive result" of the recent tragedy could be the removal of these old Karabakh militant cadres from Armenian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:23:00">[33:23:00]</a>.

### Global Migration Crisis
Immigration has reached "incredible dimensions" globally, far exceeding concerns about Syrian refugees in Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.
*   **United States**: 260,000 illegal immigrants entered in one month, with total numbers potentially reaching 500,000 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>. An estimated 2 million people are expected to enter from the Mexican border by the end of 2023, an "event of historic proportions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>.
*   **Europe**: Similar patterns are observed with migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Italy and other European countries, causing concern about the destruction of "social fabrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>.

Two main explanations for Western governments seemingly encouraging illegal immigration are proposed:
1.  **Incompetence and Irresponsibility**: A lack of quality leadership cadres in Western countries, exemplified by figures like Justin Trudeau or Annalena Berb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Need for Cheap Labor**: A "very conscious policy" to encourage immigration due to the impossibility of employing Western citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>. Western citizens demand high wages and have extensive social and human rights, making them expensive and difficult to employ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>. A demographic collapse (decrease in white Europeans and Americans) also contributes to the lack of available labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:00">[38:56:00]</a>.

This policy is seen as a new version of historical slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>. Governments prefer illegal immigration so that migrants can work cheaply and be easily deported in case of "social unrest" or any "slightest mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33:00">[40:33:00]</a>, maintaining a "vague or unclear" legal status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57:00">[40:57:00]</a>.

### Ukrainian Nationalism and Nazism
During the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Ukrainian nationalists were the "strongest support," "closest friend and ally" of Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:26:00">[54:26:00]</a>. Ukraine is described as an "artificially created country" in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:38:00">[54:38:00]</a>. Western Ukrainians, who had centuries of Polish and Austro-Hungarian rule, resisted Russian rule and saw the Germans as saviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. They "volunteered for the Nasi party and the mother army with great enthusiasm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:05:00">[56:05:00]</a>.

Instead of fighting the Soviet Union, these units focused on destroying "civilian enemies in the country," leading to World War I becoming a civil war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:24:00">[56:24:00]</a>. The "real cleansing" of the large Jewish population was done by Western Ukrainian nationalists, with Germans only giving orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:39:00">[56:39:00]</a>. They also killed Russians, communists, and "chopped up the Catholic Poles nicely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:55:00">[56:55:00]</a>. One of the "bloodiest massacres of World War I" occurred in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:13:00">[57:13:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Intranational Conflicts
> Intranational wars or civil wars are struggles "where no side is right or all sides are equally right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:43:00">[57:43:00]</a>. In such conflicts, both sides will passionately claim to be right and consider it "patriotic duty" to eliminate those who disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:20:00">[58:20:00]</a>.

The actions of Ukrainian nationalists during WWII are labeled a "disgraceful genocide" and an "inhuman massacre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:51:00">[58:51:00]</a>. It is argued that "today, this Ukraine is the direct heir of Nazism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:32:00">[59:32:00]</a>, with the Ukrainian regime being a direct continuation of the Ukrainian Nazi movement of WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:46:00">[59:46:00]</a>. Western propaganda's portrayal of this as a war between "Heroic Ukrainians, Democratic Ukrainians" and "dictator Putin" is seen as an "obvious contradiction" and "lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. The admiration for Ukraine and its use of Nazi symbols leads to the inference that "Naser is not that bad, we love them, we embrace them" because "they fought with the Russians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.

Canada received a large Ukrainian immigration after World War I, with many of Western Ukrainian origin who maintained Nazi sympathies for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>. The current war has led to an "escalating and growing" official discourse where supporting Ukraine means implicitly supporting Nazi sympathizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.

### Brain Drain: Russia vs. Ottoman Empire
A comparison is drawn between the "incredible brain drain" from Russia to European countries after the 1917 revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a> and the limited impact of Ottoman cultural figures who fled the new regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.
*   **Russia**: Writers, scientists, businessmen, composers, artists, and musicians formed "the main vein of European modernism" in the 1920s and 30s, and later migrated to America, forming a "very important and influential group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.
*   **Ottoman Empire/Turkey**: Ottoman immigrants largely "became poor" or lived in casinos, with "no one among them who has achieved serious social success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

The reasons for this difference:
1.  **Quality and Quantity of Cultured People**: The educated cadres of the Ottoman Empire were "too weak to be compared to Russia," with a very small number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.
2.  **Regime Appeal**: In Turkey, the new republican regime "promised them a good future," leading the "vast majority of graduates from certain elite schools" to return or stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. In contrast, the Russian regime "declared the existing Eee order as enemies of the elite and seized their homes, properties, careers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. The brain drain from Russia involved administrative staff and rentiers, while in Turkey, the educated staff did not go abroad or returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

### Leaders Who Lost Wars and Lived Peacefully
The possibility of leaders who lost wars continuing to live peacefully in another country is explored:
*   **Kaiser Wilhelm II**: Started World War I, abdicated, and lived for many years on his farm in the Netherlands, until the 1930s or 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
*   **Idi Amin**: The dictator of Uganda, overthrown in a civil war, escaped to Saudi Arabia and lived there for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.
*   **Mikheil Saakashvili (Georgia)**: Encouraged by the US and Turkey, declared war on Russia in 2008 and was defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. He left Georgia, became Mayor of Odessa in Ukraine, but was later fired and imprisoned upon returning to Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. Saakashvili is not a good example of living a peaceful life after losing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

Regarding Zelensky, it is speculated that he may "lose his life" or "be killed before he has the chance to enjoy his properties in Florida" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>. Zelensky's early performance as a "successful actor and a comedian" in the first year of the war fulfilled the role given to him, projecting a national hero image to a willing Western public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. However, later he gave the image of a "human wreck," possibly due to "excessive cocaine use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. He then began threatening Western countries with the "psychology of a cornered cat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>. Serious infighting within Ukrainian administrative staff and NATO's difficulty in controlling the internal political situation are suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.

### State Functions and Power Structures
Engels' view that an "eastern government has never had many departments" (finance, war, public works) is considered "epic" and describes the basic functions of every traditional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.
*   **Finance (Taxes)**: The state's primary function is to collect taxes, acting as an "upper mafia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.
*   **War**: Essential for state existence.
*   **Public Works**: A developing activity used to stimulate the economy, collect more taxes, and employ people, thereby granting "great power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>.

A "deficiency" in Engels' view is the omission of a secretariat or foreign affairs department, which evolved from handling correspondence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. The Police Organization (Internal Security) and Civil Administration (provincial appointments) are relatively modern developments that gained importance in Western states from the 18th century onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. In Turkey, the Ministry of Internal Affairs combines internal security and civil administration functions, and along with the Army, has been and continues to be the "most powerful and important state organs" since the republic's inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>.

## [[historical_and_contemporary_dictatorship_comparisons | Historical and Contemporary Dictatorship Comparisons]]

The question of Turkey returning to a "complete authoritarian regime" is addressed by stating that Turkey is *already* a complete authoritarian regime, especially since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:47">[02:26:47]</a>. Beyond the current state, "huge amounts of bloodshed inside" would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:03">[02:27:03]</a>.
