[[religious_belief_and_rationality | Faith]] is often defined as belief in something impossible, even if it is proven wrong, or believing in something that cannot be given up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This includes concepts that go against basic moral understanding or conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Unquestioning Faith
Unquestioning [[debate_on_faith_and_knowledge | faith]] implies submitting without question, as seen in the biblical story of Abraham and God's command to sacrifice his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This type of [[relationship_between_reason_and_religion | faith]] is presented as a feature that can be woven into human and community life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. From a skeptical or questioning perspective, such [[religious_belief_and_rationality | faith]] is difficult to oppose with arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. If [[religious_belief_and_rationality | faith]] is defined as unconditional obedience and the ability to maintain a belief despite contradictory evidence, it is considered unassailable by falsification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Contradiction with Rationality
Concepts within [[religious_belief_and_rationality | faith]], such as the virgin birth or resurrection, are presented as trusting in something the mind cannot comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The idea is that if one believes unconditionally, without requiring any other reason or proof, they are a believer and will be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This means a complete disregard for the rational mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

> [00:04:31] There is no logical reason to follow these rules. Why does one follow these rules? Because God commanded a rational. So there is no end to these incomprehensible. The reason for these to be followed is nothing but God's inaccessibility.

## Justification and Transmission of Beliefs
In ancient societies or those without state order, the strategy to record and transmit knowledge, including [[religious_belief_and_rationality | religious belief]], was often based on the authority of ancestors ("The ancestors said") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This ancestral transmission, while considered stronger than normal hypotheses, is ultimately derived from human sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

Later, religions like Zoroastrianism developed the concept of knowledge coming from the direct intervention of God, rather than merely from ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This elevated [[religious_belief_and_rationality | religious hypotheses]] to a level of being reliable and 100% true because they were transmitted directly from above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This shift increased the level of [[religious_belief_and_rationality | faith]] required, making divine commands indisputable and absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Even if arguments appear to contradict divine statements, they cannot be challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Evolution of Religious Texts and Interpretations
[[role_of_tradition_in_religious_beliefs | Religious texts]] and their interpretations have evolved over time. The Jewish tradition, for example, shows a complex adaptation of Jewish law to contemporary life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The Talmud, a body of Jewish civil and ceremonial law and legend, is a constantly evolving text that has incorporated layers of entries, different interpretations, and even contradictory propositions over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. This process has loaded the original text with complex and different meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

### Biblical Criticism and Archeology
The Enlightenment period (1700s-1800s) saw the rise of modern biblical criticism, particularly at universities like Göttingen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. This involved examining religious texts through rigorous academic methods, analyzing their roots, and comparing them with other languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.

Archeological findings, especially from Israeli biblical archeologists, have significantly impacted the understanding of biblical narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. These findings have challenged historical accounts, sometimes revealing that certain narratives might be mythological or created for specific political purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. For instance:
*   **Multiple Creation Stories:** The Book of Genesis contains two separate creation stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.
*   **Textual Gaps:** Some parts of the text are missing or appear to have been deleted, creating gaps in the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Authorship:** Analysis suggests that different sections of texts, such as those related to Moses's laws and kingdom stories, were written by different authors, indicated by stylistic and conceptual differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Discrepancies:** Archeological evidence indicates that Jerusalem around 900 BC, during the supposed times of David and Solomon, was a small shepherd settlement of 30 neighborhoods, not a grand kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. It was around 700 BC that Jerusalem grew to a population of approximately 5,000, and later to 25,000 after the collapse of the Kingdom of Israel in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. This suggests that the narratives of David and Solomon's grand kingdoms were likely compiled later, around 700 years BC, and do not align with the archeological record for their supposed time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.

These critical approaches suggest that some biblical narratives, while presented as historical accounts, might have been later constructions reflecting political contexts, such as a continuous theme emphasizing the Jewish state's righteousness against the errors of the northern Kingdom of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.# Faith and Rationality
