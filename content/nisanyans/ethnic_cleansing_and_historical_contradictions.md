## On Ethnic Cleansing and Turkey's Historical Narrative

A recent statement by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who criticized Israel for "occupying someone's land, seizing their house, throwing them out and then bringing someone else and putting them there" and called this action "settler," is deemed accurate and true by the speaker [00:18:25]. The speaker holds respect for Hakan Fidan, considering him one of the "most decent men" among Türkiye's current governing cadres [00:19:35], [00:19:41], [00:19:46].

However, the speaker highlights a significant contradiction: while the Minister states that ethnic cleansing is wrong, the Republic of Turkey's entire historical narrative and discourse are built upon glorifying ethnic cleansing [00:20:00], [00:20:09], [00:20:13], [00:20:14]. This contradiction, though not unique to Turkey (as world history is full of examples of ethnic cleansing, and Turks are not claimed to be worse or better than others), is a point that needs to be raised [00:20:22], [00:20:26], [00:20:33], [00:20:39], [00:20:46]. A state that has insisted on and glorified ethnic cleansing for 100 years, viewing it as a great feat, cannot then object to others carrying out similar actions without facing criticism [00:20:57], [00:21:00], [00:21:07], [00:21:10], [00:21:27].

### The Nature of Ethnic Cleansing

Ethnic cleansing is described as an unfortunate constant of human history, stemming from people's inability to share scarce or limited lands, leading them to drive each other out [00:21:31], [00:21:39], [00:21:58]. To respond to this fact with mere emotional dismay ("oh my, oh how terrible") is considered foolish [00:22:09]. A person with a moral stance or one who aims to establish political value judgments on certain principles should take a clear stance on this issue [00:22:33], [00:22:37].

Ethnic cleansing is characterized as "terrible" [00:22:46]. The speaker emphasizes that "being killed is the easy part" [00:22:49]. The worst aspect is the uprooting of people and societies from their homes, leading to homelessness and profound injustice [00:23:00], [00:23:04], [00:23:07], [00:23:12], [00:23:15], [00:23:19], [00:23:23]. Murder is not considered an exaggeration [00:23:31], but the exile of a society from the lands of their ancestors' graves and works, and the denial of their past and rights, are truly "terrible things" [00:23:41], [00:23:52], [00:23:57]. People can get used to murder, as "the dead have no more problems," but they cannot get used to injustice, especially its glorification and imposition [00:24:06], [00:24:09], [00:24:13], [00:24:16].

## The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: A Historical Disgrace

The Israeli incident is viewed as a "historical disgrace" [00:24:31], [00:24:36]. It is argued that the rights of the long-settled, culturally rich Palestinian population, who had lived there for centuries, were ignored [00:24:43], [00:24:47], [00:24:49], [00:25:22]. Europeans, using the persecution of Jews as an excuse (or perhaps for other reasons), effectively gave the land to the Jews, disregarding the existing population [00:24:55], [00:24:58], [00:25:02], [00:25:06], [00:25:09], [00:25:13], [00:25:17].

The injustice done to Palestinians is highlighted: they were expelled from their lands in 1948 and again in 1967, not by sale, but through terror and force of arms, with their lands confiscated and return forbidden [00:25:49], [00:26:03], [00:26:05], [00:26:08], [00:26:13], [00:26:16], [00:26:18], [00:26:22]. They were forced into refugee camps with terrible conditions [00:26:32]. In 1967, Israel occupied these areas and established a system of cruelty and tyranny [00:26:37], [00:26:41].

### A Nuanced Perspective

While acknowledging the injustice, the speaker also notes that land disputes are as old as human history, with victors often driving out the defeated [00:26:55], [00:26:58], [00:27:00], [00:27:03], [00:27:06]. A past inclination to agree with Israel, especially around 2005, is mentioned, influenced by visits to Israel and observations of its "civilized" nature and efforts to create humane living conditions [00:27:18], [00:27:22], [00:27:41], [00:27:44], [00:27:48]. Impressions from the University of Jerusalem, Edi Kutunu, Golan Hill, and Ist were positive [00:27:56], [00:28:00], [00:28:17], [00:28:26], [00:28:31], [00:28:34]. In contrast, visits to Palestinian villages and towns revealed "misery, ignorance and filth" [00:28:43], [00:28:47], [00:28:55], [00:29:02].

However, this positive feeling about Israel has "gradually lost" over the last 20 years, as Israel's political situation has changed [00:29:17], [00:29:22]. Cadres with increasingly fanatic, "NATSI ideology" and a worldview reminiscent of 1930s Germans have come to power [00:29:27], [00:29:31], [00:29:38], [00:29:42]. This has led to Israel adopting a "we are strong, we can do whatever we want" perspective [00:30:00]. The ongoing struggle and hardening of ideology have led to views like the Israeli defense minister's recent statement that Palestinians are "not human but animal" [00:30:11], [00:30:16], [00:30:21], [00:30:26], [00:30:30], [00:30:32], [00:30:36]. Repeated bombings and massacres in Gaza have caused Israel to "completely lose its moral superiority" [00:30:48], [00:30:52], [00:30:55], [00:30:58], [00:31:02].

Today, the world is sharply divided on the Israel-Palestine issue, with the overwhelming majority of humanity (excluding America and Western Europe) siding with Palestine [00:31:13], [00:31:20], [00:31:24], [00:31:30], [00:31:35], [00:31:39]. This situation is predicted "not to end well" [00:31:47]. The possibility of a major war is very strong [00:31:52], [00:31:56]. If Iran and Arab countries fail to act against Israel's current massacre policy in Gaza, their regimes could be in danger due to popular impatience [00:32:10], [00:32:15], [00:32:23], [00:32:25], [00:32:29]. Similarly, if Arab countries abandon Iran in a potential war, they will face accusations of treason and cowardice for generations [00:33:00], [00:33:05], [00:33:16]. Thus, a big war is seen as "almost inevitable" [00:33:26].

### The Two-State Solution and Its Alternatives

The idea of peace, meaning the existing status quo, is rejected by the speaker as "bowing to difficulty" [00:39:41], [00:39:51], [00:39:54], [00:57:11], [00:57:15], [00:57:23], [00:57:29]. The current order is unsustainable, and a "war" is necessary to break it [00:57:35], [00:57:38], [00:57:41], [00:57:44], [00:57:48].

The "two-state solution," supported by many, including Russia and China, is deemed neither rational nor honest [00:40:03], [00:40:07], [00:40:10], [00:40:15]. This solution would condemn Palestinians to live under Israel's military and economic control in a narrow area, akin to a "concentration camp system" or the Bantustans and Indian reservations of the past [00:40:23], [00:40:27], [00:40:30], [00:40:32], [00:40:37], [00:40:42], [00:40:45], [00:40:48], [00:40:52], [00:40:54], [00:41:00], [00:41:16], [00:41:19], [00:41:22], [00:41:28].

Instead, two main possibilities are presented:
1.  **Palestinian defeat and cleansing**: Gaza would be "cleaned up and flattened," and the West Bank would lose further autonomy and be weakened [00:41:39], [00:41:41], [00:41:48], [00:41:53], [00:41:57], [00:42:00]. This is given a 50-50 chance [00:42:05].
2.  **Israeli defeat**: The State of Israel would cease to exist [00:42:08], [00:42:11], [00:42:13], [00:42:16], [00:42:19]. The speaker expresses hope that this would not involve a massacre of its people [00:42:21], [00:42:26].

### Historical Parallel: The Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem

A historical parallel is drawn to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, founded in 1099 [00:42:39], [00:42:44]. This state, similar in size to modern Israel, was established by Western knights and military forces [00:42:49], [00:43:00], [00:43:05]. It existed for 84 years as a powerful entity, with its second and third generations developing a unique local culture, distinct from their European origins [00:43:15], [00:43:21], [00:43:26], [00:43:28], [00:43:32], [00:43:35], [00:43:38], [00:43:40], [00:43:42], [00:43:49]. However, this state was ultimately defeated and destroyed by Saladin Ayyubi's armies around 1186 [00:44:07], [00:44:11]. Many inhabitants died, some left by ship, and some settled and converted to Islam [00:44:14], [00:44:17]. This historical precedent suggests a strong possibility of history repeating itself in the current conflict [00:44:31], [00:44:36].

The speaker finds it difficult for a Palestinian and an Israeli political entity to coexist at this stage, implying that a solution is only possible through the "elimination of one of the two sides" as a political entity [00:54:58], [00:55:01], [00:55:04], [00:55:07], [00:55:35].

## Turkish Identity and Historical Contradictions in the Ottoman Empire

A query about the identity of Turks during the Ottoman period, specifically whether they described themselves as Ottomans, is addressed [00:45:01], [00:45:09]. The speaker notes that his previous answer to this question two years prior was "ridiculously stupid and weak" [00:45:32], [00:45:40].

The clear answer is that what are today called Turks in the Ottoman Empire referred to themselves as "Muslims" [00:45:45], [00:45:48]. The uncertainty lay with Arabs and Kurds, who were considered separate nations [00:45:59], [00:46:01], [00:46:04], [00:46:08], [00:46:10]. The "ruling class" of the Ottoman Empire, speaking what is now called Turkish and inhabiting lands from the Hungarian border to Bosnia, Greece, Anatolia, the Euphrates River, and Trabzon to Lazistan, also called themselves Muslims [00:46:30], [00:46:33], [00:46:37], [00:46:40], [00:46:44], [00:46:48].

The Ottoman Empire was structured around four main "nations," defined by religion: Muslims, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews [00:46:57], [00:47:01], [00:47:03], [00:47:07], [00:47:11]. To be Armenian or Greek did not mean speaking Armenian or Greek, but belonging to a specific church and community, often speaking Turkish or other regional languages like Bulgarian or Serbian [00:47:19], [00:47:23], [00:47:27], [00:47:34], [00:47:39], [00:47:42], [00:47:44]. Similarly, the "Muslim nation" included those whose mother tongue was Bosnian, Albanian, or Laz, but their common language was Turkish [00:47:53], [00:47:56], [00:47:58], [00:48:01], [00:48:05], [00:48:09], [00:48:12]. This common language arose as a *result* of a shared identity defined by common culture, institutions, and religious beliefs, not as its cause [00:48:17], [00:48:20], [00:48:54].

The term "Turk" served as an exonym (name given by foreigners) for the Muslim population, while "Muslim" was the endonym (name given by themselves) [00:49:10], [00:49:16], [00:49:19], [00:49:23], [00:49:26]. From the 13th century onwards, "Turk" and "Muslim" became equivalent in this context, especially among foreigners in Europe, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews [00:49:48], [00:49:54], [00:49:57], [00:49:59], [00:50:03], [00:50:07], [00:50:10], [00:50:16].

Historically, "Turk" also referred to a military class from Asia that established political sovereignty [00:50:22], [00:50:34], [00:50:36]. When Europeans or Greeks used "Turk" in the 11th and 12th centuries, they referred to the administrative staff in lands under Turkish political sovereignty, i.e., those who shared the religion, ideals, and social order of the Turkish state [00:50:40], [00:50:46], [00:50:48], [00:50:51], [00:50:59], [00:51:04], [00:51:09]. Most of these individuals did not have Central Asian origins [00:51:17], [00:51:21]. Rather, Central Asian Turks established a state and a "colony," and local populations adopted their religion and served the state [00:51:23], [00:51:26], [00:51:29], [00:51:32], [00:51:35], [00:51:37].

### The Shift from Ottoman to Turk

The conceptual transformation from "Muslim" to "Turk" for the ruling segment began in the second half of the 19th century [00:52:33], [00:52:36], [00:52:39], [00:52:42], [00:52:46]. This educated and literate segment realized that if Europe had advanced significantly, the institutions of the Muslim religion were becoming a hindrance [00:52:49], [00:52:58], [00:53:03]. They decided to undergo an "identity reform" and change their name from "Muslim" to "Turk" [00:53:07], [00:53:10], [00:53:14], [00:53:17], [00:53:20], [00:53:26], [00:53:31], [00:53:34], [00:53:54], [00:53:58], [00:54:03], [00:54:06], [00:54:10], [00:54:13], [00:54:15], [00:54:20].

This transformation was initiated around 1867-68 by the Young Ottomans, like Namık Kemal and his circle, who, after escaping to Europe, began to refer to Türkiye by the name "Turkey" and themselves as "Turks" [00:54:23], [00:54:25], [00:54:27], [00:54:31], [00:54:35], [00:54:42], [00:54:46], [00:54:56], [00:54:59], [00:55:02], [00:55:05], [00:55:10], [00:55:16]. This "new Turk" identity was essentially the name of the Ottoman Muslims as perceived through a European lens [00:55:51], [00:55:56]. The speaker emphasizes that these "new Turks" share little in common with the historical Central Asian Turks, beyond political history [00:55:29], [00:55:32], [00:55:40], [00:55:45], [00:55:49]. This perspective is presented as a "key" to understanding the relationship and transformation from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic [00:56:26], [00:56:31], [00:56:35], [00:56:38], [00:56:43], [00:56:48].

## Evolution of Languages and Identity: Aramaic to Arabic

The transition from Aramaic to Arabic in Syria and Iraq before the rise of Islam is discussed [00:58:09], [00:58:19]. Aramaic is identified as a type of Syriac, specifically the Urfa dialect in the Christian world [00:58:45], [00:58:51], [00:58:57], [00:59:00], [00:59:04]. This language became dominant across the entire Middle East around 1000 BC, including Mesopotamia, Babylon, Syria, Palestine, and Jerusalem [00:59:21], [00:59:30], [00:59:33], [00:59:36], [00:59:53], [00:59:57], [01:00:03], [01:00:06], [01:00:11], [01:00:16].

Aramaic was one of the first civilizations to systematically develop a written culture, producing extensive writings from 700 to 800 BC and being the first to use alphabetic writing [01:00:27], [01:00:30], [01:00:35]. Phoenician, known for its alphabet, is described as a dialect of Aramaic [01:00:38], [01:00:41], [01:00:44]. The Aramaic language dominated a vast region including Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Southeast Turkey, and Palestine [01:00:46], [01:00:50], [01:00:53], [01:00:57], [01:01:01], [01:01:06], [01:01:11].

Around 500 BC, when the Persians conquered the Middle East, they adopted Aramaic as the *Divan* (administrative) language because of its cultural superiority [01:01:14], [01:01:21], [01:01:28], [01:01:33], [01:01:40], [01:01:42], [01:01:46]. Aramaic then flourished for 1000 years across the Persian Empire, from the Mediterranean to the Great Wall of China, becoming the common language for state administration, culture, and trade [01:01:52], [01:01:57], [01:02:02], [01:02:07], [01:02:10], [01:02:21].

The shift to Arabic began in the 6th century with the rising population and power of Arab tribes in the interior of Syria and Iraq [01:02:33], [01:02:38], [01:02:42], [01:02:45], [01:02:48], [01:02:56], [01:03:06]. These nomadic and warrior Arabs, amidst the economic weakening and population shrinkage of Byzantium (Anatolia), became a source of instability for settled Aramaic-speaking communities [01:03:12], [01:03:15], [01:03:17], [01:03:28], [01:03:32], [01:03:40], [01:03:46].

After a major revolution, the Arabs politically dominated the region, forming an Arab Empire [01:03:55], [01:03:58], [01:04:03], [01:04:06]. Arabic, originating from a more primitive social structure, naturally absorbed much from the more developed Aramaic culture, especially in written culture, law, literature, and religion [01:04:34], [01:04:37], [01:04:43], [01:04:49], [01:04:53], [01:04:56], [01:05:00], [01:05:04], [01:05:09], [01:05:13], [01:05:17], [01:05:23]. Both Jewish and Christian religious literature extensively used Aramaic [01:05:26], [01:05:28], [01:05:31], [01:05:33], [01:05:35], [01:05:39], [01:05:41], [01:05:47], [01:05:56], [01:05:59], [01:06:05], [01:06:09], [01:06:13], [01:06:21], [01:06:24], [01:06:27], [01:06:32], [01:06:35], [01:06:39], [01:06:49].

As Arabic spread, it took "everything that was useful from Aramean" [01:07:08], [01:07:10], [01:07:14], leading to Aramaic gradually fading away [01:07:18], [01:07:29], [01:07:33]. Even in the time of Harun Rashid (early 9th century, around 805 AD), 170 years after Prophet Muhammad, the majority of the population in Baghdad and its vicinity were Aramaic-speaking Christians, though the ruling class were Arabic-speaking Muslims [01:07:40], [01:07:45], [01:07:48], [01:07:52], [01:08:05], [01:08:10], [01:08:14], [01:08:18], [01:08:29]. Today, Aramaic survives only as tiny linguistic islands spoken by small minorities in Syria, northern Iraq, Lebanon, and Türkiye [01:08:31], [01:08:42], [01:08:47], [01:08:51], [01:08:53], [01:08:55], [01:08:59], [01:09:02], [01:09:09].
