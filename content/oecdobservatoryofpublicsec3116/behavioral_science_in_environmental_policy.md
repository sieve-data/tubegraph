The OECD has launched its report "Mind Shift Green: Lift Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy," reflecting the organization's commitment to supporting governments in tackling climate challenges more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18"> [00:00:18]</a>. The report emphasizes that the green transition, one of the biggest challenges of our time, is not solely about technology or policies but also fundamentally about human behavior—how people live, work, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"> [00:00:30]</a>. Progress requires a deep understanding of human behavior, as technical solutions alone are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"> [00:00:48]</a>. By focusing on human behavior, the report aims to help governments bridge the gap between bold ambitions and real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01"> [00:01:01]</a>.

## The Role of Behavioral Science in the Green Transition
Human behavior is central to achieving a green, low-carbon future, necessitating changes in the behaviors of individuals, businesses, and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42"> [00:02:42]</a>. [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] offers valuable insights into encouraging these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55"> [00:02:55]</a>. Shifting behaviors in key areas like transport, food consumption, and energy use could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00"> [00:03:00]</a>. [[Role of behavioral science in government | Behavioral science]] supports governments in shaping better policies by understanding how people make decisions, particularly relevant for demand-side strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13"> [00:03:13]</a>.

The OECD's survey on environmental policy and individual behavior (EPIC) indicates that the availability, affordability, and convenience of sustainable options are key drivers of sustainable behaviors at the household level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30"> [00:03:30]</a>. For instance, policies reducing transport emissions (e.g., taxes on high-emission vehicles, subsidies for EVs) need to be accompanied by infrastructure investments like affordable public transport or accessible EV charging stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47"> [00:03:47]</a>. Integrating [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] into policymaking is essential for governments to design effective strategies that drive lasting change by understanding and addressing factors shaping people's decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11"> [00:04:11]</a>.

The OECD's multi-disciplinary Net Zero Plus project aims to achieve Net Zero by mid-century, focusing on a rapid, just, and resilient transition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing resilience to climate impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29"> [00:05:29]</a>. Key policy papers within this project include:
*   **Demand-side policies for climate change mitigation:** Drawing on work from the IEA and OECD, this paper offers guidance on using [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to design effective interventions in energy use in buildings, transport, waste, and diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01"> [00:06:01]</a>. Tools like green defaults, social influences, and choice architecture have proven effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31"> [00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Role of the government-citizen interface in driving climate action:** This explores how governments can engage citizens more effectively, leveraging OECD's work on trusting government, citizen participation, public communication, and [[Behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45"> [00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Exploring positive tipping points:** This work stream investigates how social, economic, and political tipping points can lead to systemic shifts and accelerate emission reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17"> [00:07:17]</a>. Behavioral mechanisms like choice architecture, social norms, and peer effects can play a pivotal role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40"> [00:07:40]</a>.

### Trust in Government
Governments are at the heart of the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20"> [00:09:20]</a>. The OECD has been working with various governance communities to mainstream "greening government" by transforming government operations and increasing their role in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26"> [00:09:26]</a>, including green budgeting and regulating for the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50"> [00:09:50]</a>.

OECD surveys indicate a low level of trust in government and public institutions, with less than four out of ten citizens in 30 surveyed OECD member countries expressing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41"> [00:10:41]</a>. Despite high expectations for governments to prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting climate transition, only 42% of surveyed citizens are confident their country will achieve this goal within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04"> [00:11:04]</a>. This highlights a significant "trust gap" between expectations and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37"> [00:11:37]</a>. [[Behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral science]] helps bridge this gap by aligning policies with public expectations, fostering trust, and making engagement easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00"> [00:28:00]</a>.

## Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy
The policy paper identifies six trends illustrating how governments are harnessing [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral science]] to accelerate the green transition, based on an analysis of over 100 case studies from more than 30 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12"> [00:15:12]</a>.

### Trend 1: Informing Policies at Every Stage of the Policy Cycle
Traditionally, [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] was often used late in the policy process to fine-tune existing policies or improve communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10"> [00:18:10]</a>. Analysis shows a rapid shift, with policymakers now using [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral science]] at every stage, including the very start, to better understand behavioral challenges and design smarter, more effective policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31"> [00:18:31]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] Repairability Index in France
>The French interministerial directorate for public transformation developed a repairability index for electronic products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02"> [00:19:02]</a>. They applied [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] at every policy cycle stage:
>1.  **Problem Analysis:** Identified that 62% of consumers discard broken electronic devices without considering repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24"> [00:19:24]</a>.
>2.  **Design & Test:** Used [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to design and test labels empowering consumers to make informed choices about laptop repairability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39"> [00:19:39]</a>.
>3.  **Implementation & Assessment:** The most successful label was implemented, leading to consumers opting for laptops with higher repairability scores and manufacturers introducing more repairable models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52"> [00:19:52]</a>.
>This intervention was effective on both consumer demand and product supply sides, highlighting the effectiveness of applying [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] comprehensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18"> [00:20:18]</a>.

### Trend 2: Driving Climate Adaptation Efforts
While [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral science]] traditionally focused on climate mitigation (reducing emissions), it now plays a larger role in climate adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42"> [00:20:42]</a>. Adaptation involves adjusting behaviors to deal with immediate and long-term climate change effects, such as preventing wildfires or guiding actions during floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56"> [00:20:56]</a>. Effective adaptation policies must be grounded in how people actually behave, leading policymakers to increasingly turn to [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral science]] for smarter, more responsive strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14"> [00:21:14]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] Farmer Drought Assistance in Australia
>During a severe drought in Eastern Australia (2017-2019), uptake of available farmer support was low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42"> [00:21:42]</a>. The Australian government's Behavioral Economics Team (BETA) identified barriers and motivators influencing farmers' willingness to seek help:
>*   **Awareness vs. Action:** Farmers knew about government assistance but didn't know how to concretely ask for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38"> [00:22:38]</a>.
>*   **Complexity & Delay:** The application process was overly complicated and lengthy, causing farmers to wait until their situation became critical before seeking help, partly due to stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47"> [00:22:47]</a>.
>*   **Lack of Personalization:** Information often lacked personal relevance to specific farmer situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13"> [00:23:13]</a>.
>BETA recommended reframing support with [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to encourage earlier assistance-seeking and establishing trusted local points for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26"> [00:23:26]</a>.

### Trend 3: Predicting and Accounting for Public Acceptability of Green Reforms
Governments are increasingly using [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to predict and account for public acceptability of green reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56"> [00:23:56]</a>. Understanding public perception and response is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07"> [00:24:07]</a>. Leveraging data, especially longitudinal data, helps governments gauge citizens' climate awareness, support for reforms, preferences, and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12"> [00:24:12]</a>. This allows for clearer, more accessible policies aligned with public values, ultimately building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25"> [00:24:25]</a>. Transparently refined policies based on such insights can boost public engagement, encourage sustainable behaviors, and strengthen green reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34"> [00:24:34]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] SME Sustainability Investments in the Netherlands
>The [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] team at the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy researched behavioral drivers and barriers affecting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their sustainability investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01"> [00:25:01]</a>.
>*   **Findings:** While 64% of SMEs were inclined to make their businesses more sustainable while maintaining profitability, only 5-18% had taken feasible steps, and only 17% had concrete plans within five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40"> [00:25:40]</a>.
>*   **Motivators:** High energy prices, cost savings, and compliance with legal obligations were key motivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13"> [00:26:13]</a>.
>*   **Barriers:** High perceived costs (time and money) and preference to allocate resources to other priorities were significant barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30"> [00:26:30]</a>.
>These results were instrumental in shaping concrete policy approaches tailored to the behavioral realities of SMEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48"> [00:26:48]</a>.

### Trend 4: Boosting Citizen Participation in Environmental Policies
Governments and civic society actors are finding proactive and inclusive ways to engage citizens in shaping and [[implementing_behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | implementing behavioral insights in public policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20"> [00:27:20]</a>. By applying [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]], they mobilize diverse groups and create more opportunities for public involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29"> [00:27:29]</a>. This is crucial given that many citizens feel they lack meaningful chances to participate in policymaking, as shown by the OECD trust survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43"> [00:27:43]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] National Dialogue on Climate Action in Ireland
>This initiative engages citizens directly in climate action through three main actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26"> [00:28:26]</a>:
>1.  Raise awareness, understanding, and engagement of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45"> [00:28:45]</a>.
>2.  Motivate, enable, and empower citizens to adopt sustainable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51"> [00:28:51]</a>.
>3.  Use findings to inform policy responses and [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59"> [00:28:59]</a>.
>Since 2021, over 12,000 citizens have participated in annual climate conversations, and more than 1,000 stakeholders engaged in forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06"> [00:29:06]</a>. A key outcome is a behavioral insights dashboard that allows policymakers to integrate evidence from social and behavioral studies into policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36"> [00:29:36]</a>. This program provides valuable insights into public motivations, barriers, and abilities regarding climate action, enabling the development of targeted solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00"> [00:30:00]</a>.

### Trend 5: Increasing Demand for Sustainable Goods, Services, and Technologies
Governments are increasingly using [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral science]] to drive demand for sustainable goods, services, and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29"> [00:30:29]</a>. Demand-side policies are essential, with the potential to reduce emissions by as much as 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41"> [00:30:41]</a>. This includes:
*   Designing and testing labels to encourage sustainable consumer choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58"> [00:30:58]</a>.
*   Removing barriers to increase the use of green services like public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07"> [00:31:07]</a>.
*   Encouraging the adoption of green technologies (e.g., heat pumps) by making them financially appealing and adoption easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14"> [00:31:14]</a>.
These efforts demonstrate how demand-side policies can unlock significant progress in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28"> [00:31:28]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] Climate Labels for Food in Denmark
>The Danish Competition and Consumer Authority tested two types of climate labels to guide consumers toward sustainable food choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44"> [00:31:44]</a>:
>*   **Best-in-class label:** Highlighted the top-performing product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00"> [00:32:00]</a>.
>*   **Scale label:** Ranked products based on climate impact from low to high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05"> [00:32:05]</a>.
>Consumers preferred the scale label, but it did not lead to a significant change in overall purchasing behavior in the experiment, with the aggregate effect on CO2 emissions being neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15"> [00:32:15]</a>. While some consumers changed purchases to reduce emissions, others with little interest in climate labels increased theirs, balancing the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41"> [00:32:41]</a>. The team suggested that labels need to provide clearer, more specific information that resonates stronger with consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16"> [00:33:16]</a>. This highlights that widespread behavior change requires not only better labeling but also consumer engagement and education on environmental impacts of food choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33"> [00:33:33]</a>.

### Trend 6: Building Resilience to Climate Misinformation
Governments are leveraging [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral science]] to build resilience against and tackle the spread of climate misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49"> [00:33:49]</a>. Many are turning to [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to understand susceptibility to misinformation, factors driving its spread, and to develop strategies to counter its impact and strengthen democratic resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03"> [00:34:03]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] Canada's PARCA Initiative
>The Program of Applied Research on Climate Action (PARCA) in Canada uses [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to counter climate misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31"> [00:34:31]</a>. The team conducts national surveys and in-depth studies to assess the Canadian public's susceptibility to climate-related misinformation, aiming to understand how people think, feel, and act when confronted with it, and to identify the most harmful types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44"> [00:34:44]</a>.
>In 2024, a randomized control trial tested behavioral interventions to boost resilience to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26"> [00:35:26]</a>. These focused on:
>*   Encouraging individuals to assess information accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41"> [00:35:41]</a>.
>*   Strengthening digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50"> [00:35:50]</a>.
>*   Preemptive refutation (actively correcting common false claims) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52"> [00:35:52]</a>.
>Interventions enhancing digital media literacy and providing active preemptive refutations were most effective in reducing susceptibility and decreasing false news spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02"> [00:36:02]</a>. However, passive information about finding misinformation made people more skeptical and less accurate in identifying true headlines, suggesting unintended consequences if critical thinking tools aren't provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21"> [00:36:21]</a>.

## Moving from Insights to Action
The report encourages governments to [[implementing_behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | implement behavioral insights in public policy]] to trigger positive social tipping points—key moments where small behavioral shifts lead to large-scale, lasting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30"> [00:37:30]</a>. To move forward, governments should:

1.  **Create conditions for positive tipping points:** Identify critical moments and behaviors with potential to spark systemic change, amplifying traditional policies and ensuring enduring behavioral shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53"> [00:37:53]</a>.
2.  **Drive demand for sustainable choices:** When more people adopt sustainable behaviors (e.g., energy-efficient products, public transport), it creates a ripple effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21"> [00:38:21]</a>. [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] tools like default options and dynamic social norms can drive widespread adoption and habit changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40"> [00:38:40]</a>.
3.  **Engage citizens as active participants:** Use [[Behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] to empower people as agents of change, reducing participation barriers, building trust, and aligning policies with public expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55"> [00:38:55]</a>.
4.  **Strengthen decision-making within governments:** Integrate [[Behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] into government decision-making processes regarding environmental policies to reduce biases and improve effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19"> [00:39:19]</a>.

### Caveats
*   **Individual responsibility:** The burden of responsibility should not solely rest on individuals; the goal is to empower consumers, users, and citizens as active participants in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55"> [00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Not a silver bullet:** [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] is an important piece of a broader strategy, not a "silver bullet." A holistic approach including technology and systemic changes is necessary for meaningful progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15"> [00:40:15]</a>.
*   **Demand-side policies:** The term "demand-side policies" in this report extends beyond individual choices to include governments and industries, recognizing their power in driving procurement efforts and systematic demand shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42"> [00:40:42]</a>. Real impact demands collaboration across all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10"> [00:41:10]</a>.

## Academic Reflections

### Professor Lucia Arian, Cambridge University
Professor Lucia Arian highlighted that the OECD has been a pioneer in using [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral economics]] and [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] globally since at least 2007-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55"> [00:42:55]</a>. The OECD's work has built an impressive network of specialists interested in using [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] in national governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35"> [00:43:35]</a>.

Lucia Arian's reflections on the trends:
*   **Integration across the policy cycle:** This trend is a "hopeful" development, allowing for bottom-up input where people in direct situations best understand the real problems and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08"> [00:44:08]</a>. This complements top-down mandates, making policies more practical, widely accepted, and capable of fostering systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00"> [00:45:00]</a>. It has become part of good governance, aligning with approaches from organizations like the World Bank and UN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38"> [00:45:38]</a>.
*   **Localized and adaptive climate solutions:** The increasing relevance of adaptation, unfortunately due to slow mitigation progress, makes [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral approaches]] crucial for tailored, community-specific strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12"> [00:46:12]</a>. Micro-interventions have significant potential for problems like wildfires, which are often behavioral in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58"> [00:46:58]</a>.
*   **Demand-side policy:** It took a long time for demand-side policy to be acknowledged in mitigation efforts, with the IPCC report finally including a dedicated chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23"> [00:47:23]</a>. Encouraging sustainable consumption through choice architecture and social norms is highly relevant, as 30-40% of potential impact lies in demand-side policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46"> [00:47:46]</a>. It's important to differentiate between "doing sustainability" and "buying sustainability," emphasizing that habits and actual use are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10"> [00:48:10]</a>.

Concerns raised by Lucia Arian:
*   **Public engagement, acceptability, misinformation:** There's a "huge epistemological crisis" where social tribes interpret facts differently, making true deliberative processes difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58"> [00:48:58]</a>. [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral approaches]], participation, and deliberation can provide platforms for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21"> [00:49:21]</a>.
*   **Disinformation:** Misinformation was a top worry at Davos, recognizing its huge implications for democracy and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51"> [00:49:51]</a>. [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral approaches]] like inoculation strategies are important in this fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16"> [00:50:16]</a>.
*   **Trust in government crisis:** World leaders deliberately interweave fact, fiction, and fantasy, leading to low public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27"> [00:50:27]</a>. Surveys show significant public grievance and support for hostile action to force change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42"> [00:50:42]</a>. There's a need to reinstall trust in experts and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17"> [00:51:17]</a>.
*   **Backlash against everything green:** There's a significant "greenlash," particularly from the US, with some leaders dismantling decades of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30"> [00:51:30]</a>.
>[!INFO] Solution
>[[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral approaches]] are valuable tools, especially as big systemic changes become more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02"> [00:52:02]</a>. Smaller, adaptable, local, and participative interventions (like "speedboats" rather than "tankers") can be helpful for horizontal trust-building, motivating local sustainability, and building acceptability through participation and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18"> [00:52:18]</a>. "Deep listening" (empathy and understanding other opinions) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51"> [00:52:51]</a>. Academia must be honest about confidence levels in research and actively detect "dark nudges" or "dark patterns" to counter manipulative forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26"> [00:53:26]</a>.

### Professor Sanchayan Banerji, Kings College London
Professor Sanchayan Banerji praised the report as timely, novel, and comprehensive, noting OECD's long-standing leadership in [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] and environmental policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00"> [00:55:00]</a>.

Key themes from the report:
*   **Backed by climate science:** The report rigorously demonstrates that behavior is a key driver for climate action, supported by extensive case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35"> [00:57:35]</a>. Humans care about services, and the goal is to shift from fossil-based sources to greener ones by changing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25"> [00:59:25]</a>. Smaller daily actions like changing diets or transport can contribute significantly to mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45"> [00:59:45]</a>.
*   **Citizen-led, participatory, people-centered approach:** This reinforces previous OECD work, addressing trust in institutions, acceptability, and public support for policies like carbon pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14"> [01:00:14]</a>. [[Behavioral public policy | Behavioral science]] can help overcome barriers to harder measures, with softer policies phased in first to build understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24"> [01:01:24]</a>. Building agency and autonomy in decision-making emphasizes the need for bottom-up tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35"> [01:01:35]</a>.
*   **Clear, actionable environmental policy guidelines:** The report provides practical guidance for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33"> [01:00:33]</a>. The [[behavioral_public_policy | behavioral public policy]] toolkit is expanding beyond nudging to include "boosting" (competency-building, educative strategies) and "nudge plus" (prompting critical thinking alongside nudges) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04"> [01:02:04]</a>.

Opportunities and future considerations:
*   **Holistic use of [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]]:** While increasing, using [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] at all policy phases is not yet the norm, with room for more integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13"> [01:03:13]</a>. It's also important to recognize and address the biases of policymakers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33"> [01:03:33]</a>.
*   **Regulating the supply side:** [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] can play a role in better regulating the supply side and suppliers, potentially through tools like "budges" that use [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] to restrict and regulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14"> [01:04:14]</a>.
*   **Testing policy combinations:** It's important to test combinations of fiscal and [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral policies]] and explore policy sequencing, building on the effectiveness of softer policies before harder ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42"> [01:04:42]</a>.

## Country Perspectives

### Australia: Josh Reynolds, Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water
The OECD paper "Mind Shift Green: Lift Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy" arrives at a crucial moment for Australia's transition to a low-carbon economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07"> [01:07:07]</a>. The paper's central message is that the green transition is fundamentally a behavioral transition, requiring more than just new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20"> [01:07:20]</a>. Success in supporting transitions (e.g., gas to electric appliances, energy-efficient technologies, adaptation strategies) hinges on understanding human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41"> [01:07:41]</a>.

Embedding [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] from the start of policy design leads to much better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53"> [01:07:53]</a>. In Australia, public concern about climate change doesn't always translate into support for energy or environmental policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05"> [01:08:05]</a>. Given unique challenges in transitioning regional and resource-dependent economies, [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] are critical for designing policies that work for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18"> [01:08:18]</a>.

The OECD's evidence-backed frameworks are valuable for advocating [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral approaches]] in major policy reforms, especially in tight fiscal environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25"> [01:08:25]</a>. The framework around positive social tipping points is particularly relevant for Australia, potentially accelerating transitions in areas like rooftop solar adoption, electric vehicle uptake, and community energy projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59"> [01:08:59]</a>.

Evaluation in Australian climate and energy policy is crucial, particularly with the 2022 Climate Change Act setting a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17"> [01:09:17]</a>. This means measuring not just program participation but whether interventions lead to sustained changes in energy use, transport choices, and household consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31"> [01:09:31]</a>. For Australia's diverse communities, measuring both immediate impacts and longer-term behavioral shifts is essential for creating lasting changes toward a low-carbon economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00"> [01:10:00]</a>.

### Germany: Dr. Malte Patterson, German Federal Chancellery
The German federal government is delighted about the "Mind Shift Green: Lift" policy paper, as the green transition is a focus of the current government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07"> [01:11:07]</a>. The collection of case studies and trends shows that not every problem needs to be solved anew, and there's much to learn from existing good [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral policy]] designs within the [[international_collaboration_in_behavioral_policy | international community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15"> [01:11:15]</a>.

The German federal government, specifically its unit for citizen-centered policy design, is developing structures to leverage the use of [[Behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] from within:
1.  **Behavioral Science Network (BIG):** Called "behavioral insights connect for green transition," this network facilitates regular exchange between scientists and policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16"> [01:12:16]</a>. Policymakers can directly pass questions to a specialist group of [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral scientists]] who create peer-reviewed policy briefings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28"> [01:12:28]</a>. They are also piloting "social science surgery" workshops where scientists and policymakers jointly develop solutions, ensuring they are evidence-based, legal, and practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44"> [01:12:44]</a>.
2.  **Policy Check for Citizen-Centeredness:** Convinced that understanding people's reasons for their actions is a prerequisite for acceptable policies, they've developed tools encouraging policymakers to incorporate citizen insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21"> [01:13:21]</a>. These tools provide advice and resources for gaining insights through small-scale research projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45"> [01:13:45]</a>.

## Q&A Highlights

### Addressing the "Greenlash" and Engaging Governments
Martha Stoke from UNEP asked how to best position academic reports and assessments with governments given the "greenlash" against the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31"> [01:15:31]</a>.
Lucia Arian suggested that while [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] cannot change the worldwide agenda, it can show good examples where [[behavioral approaches]] have worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10"> [01:16:10]</a>. It's crucial to offer examples tailored to specific policy fields, regions, or countries, ensuring policymakers see a tangible benefit and addressing their concerns about low-risk, low-key interventions in contested areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49"> [01:16:49]</a>.

### Digital Technologies and AI in Environmental Policy
Arno Fontan asked about leveraging digital technologies and AI with [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to enhance environmental policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36"> [01:18:36]</a>.
Sanchayan Banerji noted the increasing discussion of AI's role in reshaping governance and in the [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52"> [01:18:52]</a>. One key opportunity is personalizing interventions for different consumer groups, moving beyond a "one-size-fits-all" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10"> [01:19:10]</a>. Advances in computational social science and machine learning allow for training data sets to identify population clusters, enabling iteratively targeted and segmented interventions for greater effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33"> [01:19:33]</a>.

### Behavioral Interventions for Industries and Businesses
Rachel McAn inquired if [[behavioral interventions]] could work for industries and businesses, or if traditional regulatory solutions are always needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09"> [01:21:09]</a>.
It was affirmed that [[behavioral interventions]] can work for industries and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30"> [01:21:30]</a>. Examples like default options can apply to both private households and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40"> [01:21:40]</a>. Lucia Arian added that a lot of [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] are used internally for "greening employee behavior," within industry associations, and in negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21"> [01:22:21]</a>. Wherever people make decisions impacting climate and the environment, [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] can be and are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50"> [01:22:50]</a>. The distinction lies in legitimacy: commercial entities using [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] is different from governments, who are responsible to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27"> [01:23:27]</a>.

### Frictions Between Climate Adaptation and Mitigation
Mikel Hendriks expressed concern that more attention is shifting to climate adaptation rather than mitigation, fearing that easier-to-support adaptation policies (local, quicker, visible effects) could divert resources from essential mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12"> [01:24:12]</a>. He questioned if [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral scientists]] should warn policymakers about this potential imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48"> [01:25:48]</a>.
It was acknowledged that climate adaptation is often seen as more acceptable politically, as even skeptics agree on the need to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14"> [01:26:14]</a>. However, it's crucial for the applied [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] community to examine potential backfiring effects: how encouraging behaviors for adaptation might negatively impact mitigation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10"> [01:27:10]</a>. Lucia Arian emphasized that there should be a clear hierarchy: first avoiding (mitigation), then adapting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53"> [01:27:53]</a>.

The OECD remains committed to advancing the use of [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to accelerate the green transition and deliver policies that are effective, evidence-based, impactful, inclusive, and behaviorally informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56"> [01:28:56]</a>. Understanding human behavior is key to creating real-world solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17"> [01:29:17]</a>.
