Public policy implementation, particularly in the public sector, presents unique [[challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges]]. These include navigating international borders, fostering collaboration, and adapting to diverse local contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The journey to effective implementation is often neither "flashy" nor "flawless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, through structured experimental approaches and cross-border cooperation, governments can find positive [[challenges_and_solutions_in_public_service_delivery | solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## The Innovation Incubator: An Experimental Approach

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) initiated an "Innovation Incubator" program to address these complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This program acts as a safe space for governments to exchange ideas, learn from each other, and adapt their approaches based on accumulated knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The incubation process itself is experimental, and its positive reception from the global community confirmed its potential benefit for participating countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Key aspects of this approach include:
*   **Bringing Value to Projects** The incubator aims to bring value to ongoing government projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Safe Space for Cross-Border Work** It provides a secure environment for teams to collaborate across international borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Learning Together** The program fosters mutual learning, enabling continuous improvement by accumulating shared insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Peer Learning and Expert Nurturing** It combines a peer learning process with insights from experts to nurture the initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Recognition and Visibility** The program offers well-deserved recognition and visibility to government teams for their efforts in producing impactful initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Support** It is designed as a long-term support process, emphasizing the importance of weaving close relationships and building trust among teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Iterative Learning Loops** The process, which started in December 2023, uses iterative loops to generate knowledge and improve the program as it progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Identifying Challenges and Solutions

An initial global exploration of 88 public sector incubators and accelerators highlighted two major takeaways:
1.  **Border Impediments** International borders still hinder collaboration between governments, unlike in other sectors where cross-border efficiency is higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
2.  **Need for Shared Platforms** There is a clear need to strengthen cross-border collaboration through shared platforms, especially because many challenges are transversal or very similar across different countries, necessitating shared tools, learnings, and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Based on these findings, the program aims to transform "blind spots" (where borders impair government collaboration) into "sweet spots" by making the obstacle itself the focus of the incubator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This led to the development of a Government-to-Government Innovation Incubator model that promotes cross-border collaboration among governments facing similar [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_public_sector_innovation | innovation challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Program Structure

The incubator identified four core challenges from diverse countries and then sought solutions from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>:

*   **Challenge 1: Promoting Broader and More Equitable Digital Participation (Brazil)**
    *   **Problem:** Brazil aims to improve access and inclusiveness for underrepresented and marginalized groups, such as low-income and black populations in urban peripheries, who face barriers like infrastructural access or digital literacy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Ensuring digital inclusiveness is crucial for equitable participation and reinforcing democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
