From: [[oecdobservatoryofpublicsec3116]] <br/> 

Governments are rethinking how they regulate to realize the benefits of [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] and develop more [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile approaches to regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. There is a need to create space for [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimentation]] to foster policy learning and adaptation, and to incentivize businesses to develop new products, services, and business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

Regulatory sandboxes are highlighted as a "super interesting case" among [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile approaches to regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. They involve a range of practices across different areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

## Objectives of Discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>

The discussion aims to:
*   Take stock of existing practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   Demystify what a regulatory sandbox is in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   Provide insights on how to mainstream this approach across governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   Highlight opportunities and potential drawbacks of regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   Discuss how to combine sandboxes with broader regulatory tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   Bridge the gap between government perception and practical reality of regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Main Contributions of Regulatory Sandboxes

A poll revealed that 65% of respondents believe the main value of regulatory sandboxes is to gain insights from businesses on what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This addresses the regulatory lag where government lags behind innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, allowing for insights into risks, opportunities, and regulatory overlaps/gaps at early stages of technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## The Innovation-Friendly Regulator: UK ICO Example

Stephen Almond from the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK data protection regulator, describes their role as a steward of the digital economy, supporting its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. The ICO's approach to being an [[anticipatory_innovation_and_governance | innovation-friendly regulator]] includes:

*   **Fostering Trust:** Ensuring personal information is processed safely and responsibly is key to realizing economic opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Sandbox Definition:** For the ICO, a regulatory sandbox enables innovators developing new ideas, products, services, or business models (using personal data) to test them under regulatory supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. This gives innovators confidence in compliance and accelerates trusted products to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.
*   **Areas of Work:** ICO's sandbox has supported work in tackling financial crime and biometric solutions at airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.
*   **Safety and Transparency:** Sandboxes are "a place to play with safety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>. The ICO ensures appropriate safeguards and transparency, publishing reports for each participant to share guidance and advice publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond the Sandbox:** Regulatory sandboxes are important but are only *one part* of a broader strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. They are focused on intensive projects requiring detailed support and controlled testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Innovation Hub:** Offers direct advice and guidance to innovators, including SMEs, on regulatory implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Foresight Program:** Understands emerging technologies and [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Promoting Technology Adoption:** Drives regulatory goals, e.g., tech sprints on privacy-enhancing technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Supporting Industry-Led Governance:** Develops codes of conduct and certification schemes to simplify compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Competitive Market Upholding:** Works with competition authorities and the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum to ensure aligned approaches and facilitate trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.
    *   **International Cooperation:** Pursues international regulatory cooperation for global data flow and digital products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>.

## Current State of Play

### EU Member States (Survey by Slovenian Ministry of Administration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>

*   **Prevalence:** 19 EU member states have experience with regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>. Most were established in 2019-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>.
*   **Legal Basis:** Some cases leverage existing regulations for [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. Others adapt primary or secondary legislation, often through exemptions, derogations, special rules, or agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>. Germany has published a handbook for regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>.
*   **[[sectorspecific_applications_of_regulatory_sandboxes | Sector-Specific Applications]]:** Majority are in finance and transport, with increasing adoption in the energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.
*   **Duration & Size:** Most last about five years or only one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:15:00">[33:15:00]</a>. Participant numbers vary widely, from a few hundred in the Netherlands to only one in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:37:00]</a>.
*   **Impact:** Over 20% have already resulted in regulatory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:14:00">[34:14:00]</a>, while for half, it's too early to tell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>.

### EU Level (European Commission) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>

*   **Existing Experimentation Clauses:** EU law already includes clauses encouraging or allowing [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimentation]] in areas like aviation security, food, and cereal seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:34:00">[36:34:00]</a>.
*   **Express Regulatory Sandbox Use:** The term "regulatory sandbox" is more recent. Examples include proposals for artificial intelligence and the financial sector, particularly related to blockchain and distributed ledger technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:03:00">[37:03:00]</a>.

### Danish Experience (Government and Business Perspectives)

The Danish Energy Agency launched its first regulatory sandbox program in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a>.

#### Government Perspective (Suzanne Vaish Olsen, Danish Energy Agency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:08:00">[39:08:00]</a>

*   **Motivation:** Initially aimed to incentivize new ideas, products, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:38:00">[40:38:00]</a>.
*   **Basis:** Only allows exemptions already permitted by current legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:00">[39:51:00]</a>.
*   **Aim:** Shorten the time between identifying a regulatory issue and enacting proper regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>, helping innovative projects get started without waiting years for legislative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:35:00">[40:35:00]</a>. This helps "future-proof" legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:52:00">[40:52:00]</a>.
*   **Experience:**
    *   Great for communication and gaining insight into the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>.
    *   Projects tend to be complex, often related to infrastructure, not just digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:34:00">[41:34:00]</a>.
    *   Provided quick awareness of the need to design internal processes and prep expert internal teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:13:00">[42:13:13]</a>.
    *   Many projects initially identify a regulatory barrier but receive guidance that resolves the issue without needing regulatory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:50:00">[42:50:00]</a>.
*   **Guard Rails:** Significant thought is given to the delineation between the sandbox and regular regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>.

#### Business Perspective (Anders Larsen, GreenLab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>

*   **Complex Projects:** GreenLab operates an industrial "green park" combining large industry and power track solutions to optimize renewable energy and energy streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:39:00">[44:39:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying Barriers:** Initially, it was difficult to identify specific regulatory limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:32:00">[45:32:00]</a>. Collaboration with the Danish Energy Agency was "phenomenal" in identifying necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>.
*   **Obligation to Give Back:** Businesses benefit from freedom from barriers and have an obligation to provide tangible results and learning back to society, informing indirect legislation, regulation, and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:24:00">[46:24:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sector Challenges:** Moving across different sectors means bridging regulations set up to protect individual sectors, which can affect existing protections and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a>. Awareness of potential damage is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:55:00">[47:55:00]</a>.
*   **Replication and Scalability:** The goal is to set up a model for replication, turning benefits into new models that can be embedded into new laws and legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:08:00">[48:08:00]</a>.

## Key Opportunities and Challenges

### Success Factors for Regulatory Sandboxes (Genoveva Stanič) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:41:00">[49:41:00]</a>

*   **Planning:** Dedicate enough time and resources to planning. Define clear goals beyond just testing, such as societal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:08:00">[50:08:00]</a>.
*   **Clear Definitions:** Clearly define competencies, rules of procedure, and eligibility criteria to avoid application ambiguities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:58:00">[50:58:00]</a>.
*   **Assessment & Monitoring:** Plan for robust assessment and monitoring processes, including reports on success and necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:19:00">[51:19:00]</a>.
*   **Early Engagement:** Meet with potential applicants in advance to reconcile expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:55:00">[51:55:00]</a>.
*   **Effective Communication:** Crucial between regulators and innovators, emphasizing joint collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:00">[52:22:00]</a>. Consider creating "one-stop shops" where innovators can meet regulators from different ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:38:00">[52:38:00]</a>.
*   **Flexibility & Cross-Disciplinary Work:** Regulators must be flexible and prepared for cross-border and cross-sector collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>, involving specialists from diverse backgrounds (e.g., data protection, consumer protection, competition experts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:19:00">[53:19:00]</a>.
*   **Supervisory Knowledge Sharing:** Mechanisms for knowledge sharing among regulators are vital, potentially through internal innovation offices or networks of institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:07:00">[54:07:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Cross-Border Duplication:** Avoid risks of divergent supervisory practices and fragmented regulatory solutions when similar testing occurs in different member states (e.g., self-driving cars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:48:00">[54:48:00]</a>. European collaboration and guidance may be useful for specific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:59:00">[55:59:00]</a>.
*   **Public Communication:** Communicate results and information about ongoing activities to the public through various channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20:00">[56:20:00]</a>.

### Need for Common Definition or Understanding

*   **Suzanne Vaish Olsen:** Argues that the strength of a regulatory sandbox lies in its flexibility for individual member states to test specific local barriers, which might speak against a common standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:16:00">[58:16:00]</a>. However, exploring "innovation clauses" could be a path towards some standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:49:00">[59:49:00]</a>.
*   **Anne-Sophie Holden:** Suggests a three-tiered approach:
    1.  **Guidance:** This should be the first step, clarifying issues at national or local levels. It is the most [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile]] and fast route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
    2.  **Common Understanding/Mandate:** A high-level common understanding of the direction and features of a regulatory sandbox makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. Stephen Almond's definition of promoting innovation while including supervision/safeguards is a good example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.
    3.  **Express Legal Clauses:** Probably not possible to create a common legal framework across the board due to diverse cases (e.g., blockchain in finance vs. industrial emissions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. Instead, focus on common features like risk, liabilities, and limits, which depend on the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.

### Implementation Challenges

*   **Avoiding Distortion of Competition:** Concerns exist about creating special conditions for "big usual suspects" and excluding small innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>.
    *   **Knowledge Sharing:** Transparency and knowledge sharing between those in and outside the sandbox can mitigate this, ensuring all are informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.
    *   **Transparent Selection:** The selection procedure for sandbox access should be transparent and open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Conditional Operation:** Sandboxes can have terms and conditions that state they must cease if they impede competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.
    *   **Features for Broad Application:** Designing sandboxes with common features (e.g., time limits, turnover thresholds) can allow many actors to participate, potentially involving multiple competent authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>. Increased transparency and additional reporting from participants can be justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>.
    *   **Nature of Regulation:** The regulatory framework itself is a guarantee against anti-competitive behavior, ensuring all actors can operate on the same market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a>.
    *   **Predictability for Investment:** From a business perspective, a regulatory sandbox acts as a temporary subsidy, offering an advantage to enable large-scale investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>. Predictability is key for businesses to commit significant financial resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:35">[01:24:35]</a>. The advantage is expected to disappear over time as the playing field levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>.
*   **Determining the Right Level for Sandbox Initiative:** A key challenge is identifying whether a sandbox makes sense at EU, national, or local level, depending on the sector and scaling time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>. Local initiatives can scale up to national or European levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.
*   **Engaging Innovators:** Getting [[government_innovation_incubators_and_safe_spaces_for_experimentation | agile]] innovators and startups involved is challenging but important for closing the innovation gap in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **Predictability vs. Innovation:** If innovation is unpredictable, defining a clear, rigid framework from the beginning is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Resource Intensity:** Setting up and managing a sandbox is a "massive undertaking," requiring significant resources to identify challenges, manage projects, learn, and implement changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>. It may be better to start with fewer projects that have a massive societal impact and can lead to rapid regulatory adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.
*   **Setting Success Criteria:** It is difficult to set out success criteria from the very beginning, as the process needs to allow for changes in direction. "Failing is a learning and learning is part of the journey" should be integrated into the public-private working relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.

### Public-Private Cooperation

Fostering [[government_innovation_incubators_and_safe_spaces_for_experimentation | public-private cooperation]] is crucial for addressing these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>. Tight relationships and multi-faceted collaboration, with significant resources from both parties, are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>.

### [[sectorspecific_applications_of_regulatory_sandboxes | Specific Domains for Regulatory Sandboxes]]

While digitalization initially triggered the development of sandboxes in finance and transport, they appear in almost all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>. Examples include:
*   Social field (Finland: testing subsidies for entrepreneurs hiring unemployed persons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>.
*   Education (Romania: hotmail in schools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>.

Governments should test whatever is relevant for their country and not limit themselves to merely copying existing models in popular sectors like finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Part of a Broader Strategy:** Regulatory sandboxes are just one tool within a broader [[framework_for_innovation_in_the_public_sector | regulatory strategy]] to promote [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] while protecting citizens from adverse effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Approach:** Sandboxes are particularly useful at the early stages of technological development to foster policy learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>. As technology develops, governments may need to transition to other [[agile_regulatory_approaches | regulatory or non-regulatory approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:54">[01:29:54]</a>. Regulatory approaches should be dynamic, keeping pace with learning processes and the speed of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.
*   **Cross-Border Opportunities and Challenges:** Digital technologies often disregard national boundaries, making national sandboxes potentially inefficient for providing innovation incentives or mitigating adverse effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>. Cross-border regulatory sandboxes deserve attention due to the trans-boundary effects of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>.
