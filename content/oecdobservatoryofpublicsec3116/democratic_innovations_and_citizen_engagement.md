This article explores the evolving relationship between governments and citizens through the lens of [[role_of_deliberative_democracy_and_citizens_assemblies | democratic innovations]], focusing on the need for genuine citizen participation and power shifts in public decision-making. The discussion stems from a conference hosted in partnership between the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation and the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, with support from the European Institute of Public Administration and the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Shifting Relationship Between Government and Citizens

A broader shift is occurring in the relationship between government and citizens, evident through various democratic innovations from local to international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This shift is driven by changing public expectations regarding participation in public decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Evidence suggests that while citizens are less trusting of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, they are also more engaged than ever on issues affecting them and their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. People desire to contribute meaningfully to shaping decisions that impact them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

[[role_of_deliberative_democracy_and_citizens_assemblies | Democratic innovations]] are pivotal in this transformation, shifting power towards citizens and enabling them to inform and shape how policies and services are designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. These innovations aim to make [[inclusive_and_accessible_democratic_participation | citizen participation]] productive, improving public decision-making and strengthening society's [[citizencentered_governance and engagement | democratic fitness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### From Consumer to Citizen

The current default democratic situation can be described as a "consumer democracy," where the individual's role is primarily to choose from offered options that are marketed to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This contrasts with being an active participant in shaping those options, likened to being "allowed in the kitchen" rather than just choosing from a menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. There is an opportunity to infuse the same creativity and energy into the relationship between the individual and the organization, or the citizen and the state, as currently goes into consumerism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The goal is to make democracy "joyful and meaningful and dynamic," not merely a bureaucratic process of "uploading a couple of kilobytes of data every few years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This shift is an existential challenge, as failure to move towards a more dynamic and participatory democracy risks losing democracy altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Key Concepts and Initiatives

### Democratic Fitness

The concept of "[[citizencentered_governance and engagement | democratic fitness]]" emphasizes that democracy is a design that can be redesigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. It's not carved in stone but something to be actively done, trained, and practiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Without continuous engagement, democracy can become weak, incompetent, and sleepy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Strengthening democratic muscles involves training in skills like listening, empathy, compromising, and activism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

### Examples of [[role_of_deliberative_democracy_and_citizens_assemblies | Democratic Innovations]]

*   **Agora Brussels:** This initiative aims for the permanent installation of a citizen's assembly—a deliberative body of randomly selected citizens with a direct say in policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. An elected official from Agora Brussels defends the decisions of these citizen assemblies in parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This approach aims to turn citizens from "consumers of political ideas" into "agents of their own political change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **We Do Democracy (Denmark):** This organization works on redesigning and revitalizing democracy in Nordic and Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. They run programs like "democracy fitness" that train young people in democratic skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. They also operate the "Democracy Garage" in Copenhagen, a physical space for democratic innovation, allowing the "democracy sector" to meet and build solutions to specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.
*   **Conference on the Future of Europe:** This is a large democratic participatory exercise with a strong deliberative dimension, involving European citizens panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Four randomly selected citizens' assemblies meet to reflect on Europe's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. The conference utilizes a multilingual [[digital_and_virtual_engagement_for_effective_citizen_participation | digital platform]] for contributions, European citizens panels, and a plenary that mixes citizens with politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This initiative highlights the growing importance of the transnational dimension in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **UK Climate Assembly:** This was a citizen's assembly commissioned by six select committees of the UK parliament following public demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

## Challenges and Tensions

### Power Dynamics and Follow-Up
A central question for democratic innovations is the meaningful "contract of power" that citizens have when they participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. The shift in relationship must be a shift in power, where states trust citizens and put meaningful power in their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Concerns exist that processes like the Conference on the Future of Europe might disappoint citizens if their contributions do not lead to real, long-term change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

There is a risk that deliberative processes remain mere recommendations, dependent on political will for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. If governments do not trust people to make the right decisions, it undermines the very foundation of democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. The failure to assure follow-up or the "cherry-picking" of recommendations can be counterproductive, leading to frustration and undermining [[citizen_engagement_and_trust_in_uncertain_times | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. For example, the "no filter" concept in France's climate convention initially led to disappointment, despite potentially high long-term impact, because expectations were not clearly set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

The transition from representative democracy (where decisions are delegated to elected officials) to participatory democracy (where citizens demand a role) involves "birthing pains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. Citizen assemblies, rather than replacing representative democracy, can be seen as a new form of representation, requiring a redesign and rethinking of existing democratic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>.

### Digital vs. Analog Democracy
The increasing time spent in front of screens (nine hours/day pre-COVID, 13 hours/day during lockdowns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a> raises concerns about the future of physical, face-to-face interaction in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. While [[digital_and_virtual_engagement_for_effective_citizen_participation | digital engagement]] offers new possibilities, it also raises issues of privacy and the privatization of public spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. Platforms like Zoom, Twitter, and Facebook, while facilitating online participation, operate on business models that can feed "digital capitalism" or "surveillance feudalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. This shift impacts the power balance, allowing huge tech companies to influence decisions while citizens are sidelined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. A crucial aspect of protecting democracy is the right to privacy and the existence of public physical spaces for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

### Role of Media
There is a need for [[cultural_change_and_medias_role_in_shaping_democracy | cultural change in the media]] to cover innovative, future-oriented, and relatively peaceful democratic interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. Increased media attention and visibility for these processes can compel politicians to act on citizen recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

## Moving Forward

A "yes, and" approach is crucial for democratic innovations – acknowledging progress while continually pushing for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This involves both institutions extending opportunities for participation and citizens/[[engagement_with_civil_society | civil society organizations]] stepping into that power when offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

The goal is to shift from "expert-based solutions" to "people-centered solutions" by:
1.  Identifying the groups of people who will use the solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>.
2.  Analyzing their needs through direct interaction and anthropological approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.
3.  Interpreting and co-creating solutions with the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.
4.  Testing solutions and iterating the process, ensuring policies are made *with* the people, not just *for* them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.

There is a blend of hope and concern for the future of democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. Hope, as defined, is "a combination of clarity and imagination: the clarity to see the world for what it is and the imagination to see what could be if and only if we get involved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. The commitment to driving change forward lies in continually pointing policymakers to the importance of listening to citizens, fostering dialogue, and striving for a more [[inclusive_and_accessible_democratic_participation | inclusive]], deliberative, and impactful democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.
