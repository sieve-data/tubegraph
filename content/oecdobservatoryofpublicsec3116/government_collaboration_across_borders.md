The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) has launched an initiative focused on [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | government collaboration across borders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This program, orchestrated by Bruno Mon (Policy Analyst at OPSI) and his colleagues, aims to foster dialogue and address shared challenges faced by public administrations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

## The Innovation Incubator: An Experimental Approach

The program is built on an experimental approach, serving as a "safe space" for government teams to exchange ideas and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This environment encourages participants to share challenges and experiences to collaboratively find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. The incubation process itself is an experimental initiative, confirmed as positive and beneficial by the global community's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

This first edition of the Innovation Incubator seeks to:
*   Add value to participating projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   Provide a safe environment for teams to work [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | across borders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   Enable mutual learning and continuous improvement through accumulated insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   Recognize and provide visibility to government teams making significant efforts to create impactful initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
*   Offer long-term support by weaving close relationships and building trust among teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## Rationale for Cross-Border Government Collaboration

A global exploration of 88 existing incubators and accelerators for the public sector revealed two key takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>:
1.  **International borders hinder government collaboration:** Despite globalization, borders still impede effective [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | collaboration between governments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Other sectors have been more efficient in [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | collaborating across borders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Need for strengthened cross-border collaboration:** There is a well-identified need to strengthen this [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | collaboration across borders]] by creating a shared platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This is crucial because many challenges are transversal (crossing borders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, and even dissimilar challenges can benefit from shared tools, learnings, and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

The program aims to transform "blind spots" where borders impair government collaboration into "sweet spots" by focusing on this obstacle as the center of the Innovation Incubator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This led to the development of a government-to-government (G2G) [[crossborder_government_innovation | Innovation Incubator model]] that promotes [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | cross-border collaboration among governments]] sharing similar innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

## Incubator Process

The process began with a call for challenges, receiving 72 submissions from 25 different countries across all continents except Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Four challenges were selected from France, Brazil, Italy, and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

Following this, a call for solutions was issued to find government teams working on similar issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This call received 26 submissions from 18 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Although initially planning to select four solution providers, the high quality of submissions led to the selection of eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. These teams demonstrated not only experience but also a willingness to partner with colleagues for practical outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. A matchmaking exercise then paired solution providers with challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

The incubation process officially began in December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>, with iteration loops used to generate knowledge and improve the program as it progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
