The COVID-19 crisis has provided a new impetus to [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation practice]] around the world, enhancing its sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This period has revealed much about the evolving nature of [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | public sector innovation]] and what [[Government innovation and adaptation | government]] can expect now and into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The conversation aims to explore how to push conventional boundaries to spur lasting transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

A poll question was posed: "Has the COVID-19 pandemic and associated crisis made [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | public sector innovation]] something to be expected instead of questioned?" Results showed 50% said yes, 11% no, and 38.9% (rounded to 40%) said "too early to tell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Key Reflections from the Pandemic

Speakers shared key insights on the year's events:

*   **Failure to Listen Deeply**: A significant lesson is that governments have not yet learned how to truly deeply, or "radically," listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Much decision-making has been based on an outdated idea that governments know what to do and people will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This notion of government knowing all answers is a fallacy that is now unraveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Immature Participative Democracy**: Mechanisms for effective listening are lacking, and participative democracy remains immature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This limits spaces for collaboration and discussion, allowing power to be quickly assumed by a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Systemic Lack of Empathy**: Systems lack empathy and compassion, and are not optimized for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. In the US, governments asked people to trust a system that historically treated people unequally and let them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Trust from Listening**: When listening is done well, trust can grow, relationships flourish, and good outcomes can emerge even in difficult circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Infrastructure**: In an emergency, governments work with what they have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Countries that made previous investments in basic infrastructure had more options to improvise and [[Innovative responses to Covid19 by governments | innovate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Asian countries building on SARS protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
    *   African countries building on Ebola protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
    *   Investments in digital safety nets, allowing countries to stretch limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
    *   India repurposing 100,000 railway cars into ambulances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **The Power of Trust (Social Capital)**: High social capital and trust enabled new opportunities for collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, as seen in South Korea's public-private partnerships and Vietnam's low-cost testing development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Global Experiment**: The pandemic has been an unprecedented global experiment with significant learning potential from how countries coped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   **Functional Redundancy**: The importance of functional redundancy was highlighted; systems operating at 100% capacity have no way to cope with crises demanding more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **Conditions for Crisis-Driven Change**: Crisis does not always lead to change, or good change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Three conditions determine if a crisis leads to change:
    1.  Pre-existing momentum/capacity for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
    2.  Whether the crisis prefigures the future, offering glimpses of what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
    3.  Availability of ideas and coalitions to seize the opportunity when policymakers' minds are open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Policy Shifts**: The crisis accelerated two major debates in [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | public services]]:
    1.  **Policymaking Nature**: National [[Government innovation and adaptation | government policymaking]] often suffers from being too scattergun in influencing complex systems and too path-dependent, lacking agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. The crisis revealed different forms of policy-making – quicker and more quickly enacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
    2.  **Public Services Model**: New public management, described as a "massive Global failed experiment," is "dead" but still has influence due to a lack of clear alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Two opposing momentums are now visible: a technocratic imperative (digital leveling up, analytical skills, targeting) and a relational imperative (collaborative public services involving state, citizen, and community) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. The key question is whether these can be combined to create a new model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Expanded Policy Options**: Policy choices previously deemed unacceptable or heretical are now broadly tolerated, if not welcomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Examples include social distancing, free childcare, mobile apps with privacy concerns, universal basic income, and labor market subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Fluid Social Contract**: The social contract is currently very fluid, and new muscles are being built in the relationship between citizens and the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

## Sustaining Innovation Beyond the Crisis

A key concern is whether the shifts seen during the crisis are temporary or indicative of a lasting change in [[Government innovation and adaptation | government innovation and adaptation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

### Challenges to Sustaining Innovation

*   **Narrative of Success**: The future of [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | public sector innovation]] depends on the definition of success and who defines it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. If success is purely technocratic (e.g., low case numbers), there's a risk of quickly reverting to old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Reverting to Old Bureaucracy**: There is a fear that even simple, absurd bureaucratic practices (like requiring five letters for inter-ministerial meetings) might return once the crisis abates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.
*   **Political Inertia**: The system's readiness for an emergent paradigm of change is questionable, especially in political and bureaucratic scenes where traditional behaviors persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Activism Becoming Inward-Looking**: While activism (e.g., Black Lives Matter) drives progress by challenging the status quo, movements risk becoming inward-looking and detached from public sentiment, making them vulnerable to misrepresentation and losing momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
*   **Media Hostility to Experimentation**: Traditional media can be a "Paper Tiger," quick to criticize attempts at new policies if they don't immediately succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This can browbeat policymakers into avoiding needed experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.
*   **Persistent Incentive Structures**: A concern exists that the deep incentive structures in politics and government have not fundamentally changed; the current responsiveness is a temporary response to fear and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. The announcement of a vaccine brought fears of reverting to pre-pandemic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.
*   **Exhaustion**: Many levels of [[Government innovation and adaptation | government]] are experiencing utter exhaustion, which could hinder sustained change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.

### Opportunities for Lasting Change

*   **Pre-Existing Problems**: Many national governments already faced highly problematic ways of working, and the failure of new public management created a vacuum, meaning there isn't a stable status quo to which to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.
*   **Continuous Experimentation and Curiosity**: There is a strong likelihood of continued fast-paced [[Impact of COVID 19 on city planning and innovation | innovation in cities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Global curiosity about different approaches will accelerate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Politics and Coherent Progressive Cases**: The ability of progressives to articulate a coherent vision for [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | public services]] reform, avoiding internal splits, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.
*   **Responsible Private Sector Engagement**: The private sector, having previously contributed to the failures of new public management, is now more socially conscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. There's an opportunity to work with them to encourage solutions that truly work rather than just generating quick profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
*   **Citizen Activism and Demand for Change**: Communities are showing how to govern better, with movements and activists emerging, regardless of centralized government actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. People are willing to experiment and are connecting in new ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
*   **Government's Evolving Language**: Governments have begun to change their language, admitting they don't know all answers and need to try new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>. They've also shown maturity in adapting to evidence without fearing "U-turn" labels from the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Facing Complex Problems**: The undeniable truth is that the world is living in times of complexity, with no simple answers to long-standing, growing, intricate problems <a class="yt=" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. Old methods will fail for these new complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>.
*   **Widespread Experience of Poverty**: Many previously prosperous individuals have experienced poverty and fear for their futures, making poverty an undeniable fact that should force different thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Challenging Public Finance Orthodoxies**: The pandemic exposed artificial constraints on public spending, revealing "hundreds of billions of dollars of loose change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. This liberation in understanding public finance could lead to demanding more investment in public policy areas that were previously underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

## Unleashing Talent and Shifting Leadership

The pandemic has created a necessity for an experimental mindset in government, fostering agility, humility, and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

*   **Hierarchy Subversion**: Hierarchy has been subverted during the crisis, with organizations working in flatter ways and shedding elaborate systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. However, entirely flat organizations don't work beyond a certain size, and tough decisions still need to be made by leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Improvisation**: Improvisation has become a crucial skill, elevating individuals from lower ranks to important tasks based on their specific skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. The challenge is capitalizing on this newly discovered talent post-crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.
*   **Reflectivity and Humility**: A higher tone of reflectivity is noted, as the crisis reconnected people to their reasons for joining public service and brought a sense of humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.
*   **Leadership Beyond "Doing"**: Workforce members are calling for leaders to stop focusing on constant activity ("doing things") and instead on their core values and "being" – connecting with purpose, behaviors, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>. Leaders can foster this by creating safe learning environments and focusing on building bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.
*   **Making Public Service Attractive**: Leaders must make public service feel attractive to new talent by fostering a sense of real community and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

## Advice for Institutions

*   **Focus on Relationships, Not Just Content**: Organizations like the OECD should invest less in content and more in relationships, enabling people to spend time together and strengthen networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   **Challenge Zombie Orthodoxies**: Institutions should use their platform to advocate for policy shifts that enable a new era of [[Government innovation and adaptation | governance]], rather than clinging to outdated orthodoxies like new public management or traditional public finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.
*   **Embrace New Narratives**: Look to developing countries and places in Asia to radically rethink what the new narrative of success is, as traditionally considered "best practices" have been damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.
*   **Document the Innovation Dividend**: It is crucial to document the emerging "[[impact_of_covid19_on_global_innovation | innovation dividend]]" – the insights and changes happening during the crisis – to learn from them with hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>.
*   **Articulate Paradigm Shifts**: Institutions should lead and articulate the necessary paradigm shifts in [[Government innovation and adaptation | governance]], incorporating new and diverse voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.

### Personal Lessons

*   **Maintain Equanimity**: Learn to maintain equanimity, not getting overly excited by good news (like a vaccine) nor overly depressed by tragic outcomes, as there is always work to be done and constant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.
*   **Listen, Learn, Adapt**: Three essential words for the future are "listen, learn, and adapt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.
*   **Engage "Hard to Reach" Communities**: People are not hard to reach; they are seldom heard. They can be the biggest supporters and are crucial for recovery and rebuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

The period of crisis represents "plastic hours" – crucial moments when an ossified social order becomes pliable, offering opportunities for change if action is taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. These moments are rare, requiring the right alignment of public opinion, political power, and events, often a crisis, and depend on social mobilization and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. They can be wasted if unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.
