This article explores how governments can better manage [[Innovation Portfolio Management | innovation portfolios]], embrace [[Systems thinking in innovation | systems thinking]], and use anticipatory governance to respond to and prepare for complex societal challenges, drawing insights from the "Government After Shock" event on portfolios, systems, and anticipation.

## The Context of Complexity and Uncertainty
The "Government After Shock" event highlighted that governments need to anticipate, experiment, and explore [[Innovation as a response to societal challenges | systemic solutions]] to upcoming and existing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Key recurring themes from discussions included transformation, [[Innovation portfolios in the public sector | innovation portfolios]], and actions required beyond the immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The recent crisis has opened a window of opportunity for exploring new policy options and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The central question is how to sustain this momentum for innovation and transformation beyond crisis situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Navigating Complex Adaptive Systems with Innovation Portfolios

Innovation is an inherently uncertain process, and its outcomes can be largely unpredictable, making it different from modeling more static effects like income taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Society, culture, markets, regulation, and the physical environment interact as complex adaptive systems that continuously co-evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) Approach
The EIT, established to enhance Europe's competitiveness and tackle global challenges, operates as Europe's largest innovation network with over 2,000 partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
Their approach to [[managing_innovation_portfolios | managing innovation portfolios]] is characterized by:
*   **Impact-Driven Planning**: Projects are selected based on their potential contribution to the EIT's overarching mission, such as creating new products, fostering entrepreneurial skills, or regional outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
*   **Distributed Mode**: Grants are distributed through small, decentralized entities (like "beehives") where subsidiarity is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This structure maximizes interaction across disciplines and allows for bottom-up control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Agile and Adaptive Methods**: During the COVID-19 crisis, the EIT quickly deployed agile and adaptive working methods, transitioning to mission approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. They assessed their existing portfolio and created a crisis response initiative, channeling €60 million to 207 new innovation projects and ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Multi-Stakeholder Engagement**: Over 2,000 partners representing business, universities, and research organizations are involved in a constant co-creation mode, enabling rapid identification of relevant needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. This ecosystem allows them to adapt quickly and respond to unforeseen challenges, such as a product developed for antiviral surface coating becoming highly relevant during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.

## Agile Governance through Goal-Based Regulation

In the age of digitalization and complex cyber-physical systems, traditional static governance models are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. An agile and flexible governance model is necessary, leveraging technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)
Japan's METI has recognized the urgent need for digital transformation, leading to discussions about establishing a digital agency and creating a Digital Architecture Design Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
*   **Shift to Goal-Based Regulation**: Instead of detailed rule-based regulations, the focus is on goal-based rules that allow for more innovative methods to achieve regulatory objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. For example, in industrial safety, plants demonstrating high safety levels through real-time data and AI monitoring can extend statutory inspection terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Multi-Stakeholder Guidelines**: Under goal-based regulation, multi-stakeholders create guidelines and standards to help even small companies leverage technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The government's role is to identify sectors needing standards and bring stakeholders together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.
*   **Real-time Monitoring and Continuous Review**: Real-time monitoring, primarily conducted by businesses with accountability for data, is crucial for assessing if regulatory goals are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Guidelines are continuously reviewed based on feedback from real-time data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Enforcement**: Incentivizing businesses to cooperate with investigations (e.g., through default prosecution agreements) encourages information disclosure and allows the government to learn about future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.

## Anticipatory Governance in Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI)

The pandemic demonstrated an unprecedented mobilization of resources within the science and [[Innovation ecosystems and portfolio management | innovation community]], revealing new modes of cooperation across national borders and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. This offers insights into how STI can address grand challenges in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

### Foresight and Participatory Technology Assessment
The relationship between technology and society is critical and fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Technology and society co-evolve, rather than technology being a deterministic force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Governance**: This involves processes to anticipate plausible futures, enabling action in the present to shape desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Upstream Engagement**: Engaging stakeholders in the development of technology, beyond pure market influence, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. Examples include open processes for STI agenda setting (e.g., Horizon 2020) and upstream forms of governance like "safe by design" and "ethics by design" in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Living Laboratories**: These allow for the simultaneous development of regulation and technology, such as experiments in co-developing autonomous vehicles and their regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

## Lessons from the Crisis: Bridging Foresight and Action

Despite warnings from scientists about potential pandemics, COVID-19 still took the world by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. This highlights a need for:
*   **Mindset Change**: Moving beyond extrapolating the past and embracing "deep uncertainty," where the future may be radically different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Elevating the Role of Science**: The role of science in society is often too low, requiring better communication from scientists and a more receptive perception from the public and policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.
*   **Systemic Adjustments to Science Systems**:
    *   **Interdisciplinary and Transdisciplinary Research**: Future crises will be multi-dimensional, necessitating research that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries and integrates science with other social and political spheres to close the knowledge-action gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
    *   **Public-Private Sector Linkage**: The crisis underscored the importance of collaboration between academic and private sector science to leverage useful knowledge and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
    *   **Agility and Knowledge Dissemination**: Speed in reacting to crises requires accelerating the dissemination of scientific knowledge to policy circles and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.
    *   **Support for Risk-Dealing Institutions**: Stable and robust funding and support for institutions dealing with risks, such as epidemiology and public health, are crucial, especially given paradoxes where some countries defunded such institutions just before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
    *   **International Scientific Cooperation**: Global networks and science as a public good are vital, particularly for developing countries to access scientific capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

### Overcoming Barriers to Long-Term Thinking in Governance
Bringing foresight into traditional government structures with short budget and political cycles is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Benefiting Participants**: Foresight exercises must be beneficial for participants, fostering social learning or even incorporating gamified approaches (serious games) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.
*   **Mission-Oriented Approaches**: A missions orientation can bridge the gap between long-term goals (e.g., decarbonization) and actionable steps, creating incentives and forcing coordination among agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.
*   **Robust Portfolios of Options**: Given many possible future scenarios, the aim is to find robust solutions or "robust portfolios of options" – actions that work across different scenarios and offer co-benefits or multiple dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. This requires identifying interventions that are beneficial regardless of which future unfolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.
*   **Understanding System Archetypes**: Recognizing that certain system archetypes exist (e.g., "fixes that fail," "limits to growth") can help policymakers understand causality in complex adaptive systems, making it easier to identify leverage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.
*   **Adapting Reward Systems**: Reward systems for policymakers and politicians should acknowledge that clear attribution and contribution to change are often difficult to measure with 100% certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.

## Personal and Organizational Commitments
Participants committed to:
*   **Admitting Government Limitations**: Acknowledging that it's impossible for governments to plan and order everything by themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
*   **Generalizing Knowledge for Future Crises**: Ensuring that new scientific projects and research create knowledge that is generalizable for future crises, not just the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.
*   **Studying New Models of Collaboration**: Analyzing the diverse models of collaboration and cooperation triggered by the crisis across countries and sectors, to identify what might work in other contexts for public goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Being Prepared for Uncertainty**: Committing to "walking the talk" and not panicking, but being "better safe than sorry" by investing in future readiness for organizations and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>.
*   **Documenting Lessons Learned**: Writing more about action-oriented projects and providing real-time feedback on lessons learned from innovation initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.
