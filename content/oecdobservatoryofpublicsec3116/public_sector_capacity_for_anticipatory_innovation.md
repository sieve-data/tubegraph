## Introduction
The webinar on "Anticipated Capacity for Governing Institutions and Technology Policy" explored how to [[public_sector_innovation | break mental and physical silos]] within governments to foster anticipation of the future, particularly concerning technology policy and various substantive policy fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The contemporary world is increasingly complex, with problems extending beyond traditional governmental silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Key discussion points included how technology policy should interact with other governance institutions, policy areas, missions, and challenges within the public sector, and how to achieve a more integrated [[anticipatory_innovation_in_public_sector | anticipatory process]] across government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Current State of Anticipatory Capacity in Government
Attendees participated in interactive polls to gauge the state of anticipation within their governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Where Anticipation Happens
Anticipatory activities occur in various governmental contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
*   **Central government level:** Units or teams working across the government on anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Individual ministries:** Some ministries are exceptionally good at anticipatory activity, such as the Minister of Environment or Minister of Science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Agency level or government think tanks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   A significant portion of respondents indicated that anticipation does not happen in a systematic manner at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Strengths in Anticipatory Capacity
Based on the Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]]'s framework for anticipatory capacity, organizations reported strengths in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>:
*   Sense-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
*   Data measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>
*   Evidence and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   Out-of-the-box thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
*   Partnerships and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>

### Areas Lacking in Anticipatory Capacity
Conversely, organizations identified weaknesses, particularly in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>:
*   Institutional structures that support [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   Learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   Evidence and evaluation related to anticipatory topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   Addressing vested interests and cognitive biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   Public interest and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Key Observations and Approaches

### Singapore's Foresight System
Singapore has a well-established foresight and [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory governance]] system, engaging in scenario planning since the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. The toolkit diversified around 2008-2010 with the establishment of the Center for Strategic Futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This includes using various tools and methods like emerging strategic issues methodologies and causal layered analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

> "No good foresight system can exist without analyzing technology, given that it is such a source of critical uncertainties for the future." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>

Foresight involves analyzing how science, technology, and innovation (STI) interact with other trends like politics, society, and the economy, recognizing the systemic interconnectedness of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. This process happens across the entire government, including ministries, think tanks, and institutes of higher learning, forming a maturing ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Challenges in STI Ecosystems
Within the STI ecosystem, formal foresight is often lacking, not due to malice or laziness, but because various functions are highly specialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>:
*   **Research community:** Focuses on hindsight, documentation, experimentation, and exploration of hypotheses rather than future analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Commercialization agencies:** Emphasize immediate economic opportunities from STI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
*   **Policy promotion agencies:** Concentrate on current regulations and policy incentives, with foresight being a base awareness rather than a well-developed practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

The National Research Foundation in Singapore attempts to integrate these different aspects of STI, scanning and sense-making global trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

### Importance of Citizen Involvement
Involving citizens in both foresight and STI processes is crucial for shaping and understanding trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. Governments cannot have a monopoly on truth and benefit from external perspectives to update mental models and assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. Citizen engagement, such as through the "Emerging Stronger" process in Singapore, brings diverse perspectives to enrich policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. This helps [[public_sector_innovation | break silos]] because citizens think about the future and their problems holistically, forcing officials to look beyond their specific ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

### Technology Assessment Processes
A survey revealed varied levels of formalized technology assessment processes in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>:
*   Many respondents were unsure if such processes were formalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.
*   Some adamantly stated no formal process exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   Most reported these processes occur at an executive level of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.
*   Parliamentary processes for technology assessment are unique, with examples like Finland's future committees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

### The Coleridge Dilemma
A key challenge for [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory governance]] is the "Coleridge dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>:
*   **Early regulation:** In early development phases of technology, it's difficult to predict which solutions will scale, yet there's more control over ethical issues and technology design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. Risks include misguided or unnecessary regulation that constrains innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.
*   **Late regulation:** Once technologies are widely adopted, changing course becomes expensive and difficult, as the technology is built into the infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. "Code is law" highlights how technology itself can act as a governing force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

Governments often hesitate to make decisions without quantitative evidence, favoring innovation implementation over opening discussions about futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

### Upstream Governance and Design Principles
The OECD, in collaboration with experts, has articulated design [[principles_of_public_sector_innovation | principles for upstream governance]] in the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>:
1.  **Anticipation:** Addressing deep uncertainties from emerging technologies by exploring plural possible futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>.
2.  **Inclusion:** Ensuring involvement not only in access to technology but also in its production and deliberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>.
3.  **Directionality:** Setting goals and embracing mission-oriented approaches to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.

These principles guide engagement at various stages of technological development—upstream (basic research), midstream (applied), and downstream (diffusion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.

### Role of Standards
Voluntary design standards are increasingly important for global governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. They are market-friendly, have global reach, and can address complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>. Standards embody values and should be subject to democratic inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>. Concepts like "safe by design" and "ethics by design" are examples of upstream governance where values can be integrated into technology development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

## Specific Tools and Methods for Anticipatory Innovation

### Experimentation and Living Labs
[[Public sector innovation | Living labs]], test beds, real-world laboratories, and sandboxes are designated experimental spaces to test and advance transformative technologies under real-world conditions, ideally with public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>. These often involve lowering regulatory burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. The focus is shifting from merely testing technologies *in* societies to testing societies *around* new technologies, raising questions about desired societal futures and potential consequences of designated test populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

### Co-creation
Co-creation is increasingly central to [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and governance, involving diverse actors in joint innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. Examples include public procurement of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], co-creation facilities, and living labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>. While hyped, co-creation varies greatly in form and objectives, often reconfiguring power dynamics and raising questions about who shapes discussions about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>.

> [Co-creation] can provide important insights or additional inputs into some things that where they traditionally didn't used to be but they at an overt reliance also comes with considerable risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>.

Challenges include maintaining co-creation communities beyond project funding cycles and preparing the next generation of professionals to routinely deploy co-creation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

### Scalability and the Private Sector
Big Tech's influence highlights the centrality of scale and scalability in modern [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] discourses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>. The public sector also seeks scalable transformative solutions for grand societal challenges and missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>. Questions arise about framing problems as issues of scale and dealing with "solutionism"—taking solutions for granted rather than questioning what is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.

Most formalized [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory governance]] processes focus on the public sector, despite industry conducting 70% of R&D in OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. Engaging the private sector is critical:
*   Governments can define clear challenges for private sector solutions, as seen in hackathons for public policy purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">[01:37:08]</a>.
*   Private sector often has a role in anticipating future trends, but integration into governmental and citizen-led discussions is a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>.
*   Small companies may lack time or interest to engage in [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:04">[01:35:04]</a>.
*   A growing trend towards "social entrepreneurship," B corporations, and value-driven corporations can align with public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:22">[01:35:22]</a>.
*   Developing shared language around "public value" can encourage private sector participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>.

## Conclusion
Connecting the communities of foresight/anticipation for governmental systems with those doing foresight/technology assessment in STI is a "necessary connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>. The co-evolution of technology and governance means neither can be seriously considered without the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. Ultimately, the goal of public engagement is to build the deliberative capacity of various communities to engage in discussions about technology and the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.

The OECD's upcoming meeting on "Technology in and for Society: Innovating Well for Inclusive Transitions" aims to combine interest in socio-technical transitions with addressing the disruptive aspects of emerging technology, promoting principles of design and mechanisms for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.
