### [[diagnostic_images_and_their_significance | Important Diagnostic Considerations]]

*   When interpreting lytic bony lesions, age is critical for [[differential_diagnosis_in_pathology | differential diagnosis]]. In elderly patients (e.g., 60-75 years old), multiple myeloma is highly suspected, but in a young child (e.g., 1-5 years old), Langerhans cell histiocytosis should be considered instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>.
*   Cold agglutinin disease and multiple myeloma can both present with RBC clumping. Cold agglutinin disease requires a cold temperature (4°C) for clump formation, unlike multiple myeloma where rouleaux are prominent regardless of temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
