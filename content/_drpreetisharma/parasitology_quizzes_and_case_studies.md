This article details a series of parasitology quiz questions and case studies, offering insights into various parasitic infections, their diagnosis, and treatment. It also covers the overall schedule for upcoming medical revision classes, including quizzes on virology, general pathology, and specific topics for [[pathological_conditions_and_diagnostic_techniques | INI CET]].

## Overview of Revision Classes and Quizzes

The revision schedule includes:
*   **Weekly Parasitology Quizzes** Fifteen questions on parasitic topics were covered in this session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The classes will now be weekly, but may occur on different days like Tuesday or Thursday due to the instructor's commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Parasitology Case Studies

### Case 1: Bloody Loose Stools and Ciliated Protozoa

A 32-year-old male presents with bloody loose stools, fever, and abdominal pain for three days after a trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Stool examination reveals a ciliated protozoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

*   **Organism:** *Balantidium coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   **Morphology:** It is a ciliated protozoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, the largest protozoa in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Case 2: Differentiating Entamoeba histolytica from Entamoeba coli

A 22-year-old male presents with stomach discomfort, vomiting, and three days of diarrhea, with a fever of 101°F <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. A stool sample is taken to differentiate *Entamoeba histolytica* from *Entamoeba coli* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

*   **Key Differentiators:**
    *   **Motility/Pseudopodia:** *Entamoeba histolytica* shows rapid, unidirectional, finger-shaped pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, while *Entamoeba coli* has blunt, sluggish, multidirectional pseudopodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
    *   **Nucleus (Karyosome):** *Entamoeba histolytica* has a central karyosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, *Entamoeba coli* has an eccentric karyosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
    *   **Erythrophagocytosis:** *Entamoeba histolytica* exhibits erythrophagocytosis (ingestion of RBCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>; *Entamoeba coli* does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
    *   **Chromatoid Bodies:** *Entamoeba histolytica* has thick, cigar-shaped chromatoid bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>; *Entamoeba coli* has thin, splinter-shaped chromatoid bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
        *   Chromatoid bodies are made of ribonucleoproteins (RNP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a> and stain with Iron Hematoxylin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
    *   **Cyst Nuclei Count:** *Entamoeba histolytica* cysts have 1-4 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, while *Entamoeba coli* cysts can have 1-8 nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This is generally not a good distinguishing feature in practical scenarios due to overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** *Entamoeba histolytica* causes flask-shaped ulcers in the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a> and "anchovy sauce" appearance in liver abscesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. *Entamoeba coli* is often a normal gut inhabitant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

        *   *Acanthamoeba* trophozoites have "spikes" (acanthopodia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>, and its cysts are wrinkled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
        *   *Balamuthia mandrillaris* trophozoites are fish-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>, and its cysts are smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.
    *   **Associated Conditions:** *Acanthamoeba* also causes keratitis/corneal ulcers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>; *Balamuthia* does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
