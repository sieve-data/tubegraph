Artists and creators are often driven by deeply personal motivations, shaping their unique approaches and the impact of their work. These motivations can range from a desire for creative freedom to an irrepressible instinct to bring an idea to life, often pushing boundaries beyond industry expectations.

## The Climber: Shinichi Sakamoto's Pursuit of Meaning
Manga author [[influence_of_reallife_mountaineers_in_manga | Shinichi Sakamoto]] began his series "The Climber" in November 2007, basing it on the story of mountaineer Kato Buaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Initially, Sakamoto was the illustrator, with Yoshiro Naida as the writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. However, after Naida's departure, Sakamoto gained full [[Artistic evolution and creative freedom in manga | creative freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

This shift allowed Sakamoto to:
*   **Retell a real story:** He aimed to create a story about the real Kato Buaro, seeking to understand his motivations for extreme mountaineering, particularly his "irrepressible instinct of the spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Experiment with artistic approach:** Sakamoto changed the [[Impact of unique artistic styles in comics and manga | artistic approach]], depicting rock climbing through [[Analogies and visual metaphors in storytelling | visual metaphors]] rather than purely realistic portrayals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. He also significantly increased the frequency of double-page spreads, despite doubling his workload, driven by a desire to create a "visually stunning piece of fiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Seek personal meaning:** "The Climber" ultimately became a story mirroring Sakamoto's own journey as an author "trying to seek that meaning through the process of making his story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Alex Ross: Believable Superheroes and Legacy
Alex Ross, a painter and comic artist, was deeply inspired by superheroes, seeing them as embodying virtues and reminding him of Greek gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. He was also influenced by hyperrealist painters like Andrew Loomis, Norman Rockwell, and Salvador Dalí <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

His core motivations included:
*   **Bridging fine art and comics:** Ross wanted to find meaning through fine art but also make comic books, believing the goals of painters and superhero comics were similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Creating believable heroes:** He aimed to be the first to depict superhero stories in their most believable form, making them relatable like "a friend, a teacher, a neighbor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. For "Kingdom Come" (1996), he and Mark Waid wanted to portray superheroes in a "what if they were actually actually real" way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Leaving a lasting impression:** Ross had a "self-absorbed sense" that he was "making a legend" that would be read and perceived for "years and years to come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. He cared deeply about the verisimilitude of his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

## Dave McKean: Embracing Unrealistic Perceptions
Dave McKean, a painter and abstract artist, was hired by DC in 1988 for "Black Orchid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. His art was so impactful that it changed the publisher's mind about releasing the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

His motivations were often rooted in challenging conventional comic book aesthetics:
*   **Depicting subjective reality:** McKean sought to create comics from the perspective of someone unable to properly perceive reality, due to "chemical imbalance in their brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   **Refusing "cookie-cutter" treatment:** For "Arkham Asylum," McKean "couldn't be fucked" to give it a conventional look, believing such a story "didn't deserve the cookie cutter treatment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. He refused to fulfill industry expectations and depicted the story in a way that made sense to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

## Haruko Ichikawa: Biology, Evolution, and Unique Rules of Nature
Haruko Ichikawa's manga works often explore themes through a biological lens, creating stories where Earth operates under "a couple different rules about its nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

Her motivations include:
*   **Expressing themes through biology:** She has a "strong desire of wanting to make fiction that expressed its themes through biology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
*   **Guiding the reader's eye:** Her background as an editorial designer influenced her use of negative space to "invoke the mood of her stories" and guide the reader's eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.
*   **Exploring existential questions:** Her characters often grapple with questions of identity and self, as seen in "Land of the Lustrous," which asks, "how much of yourself are you willing to lose in pursuit of your own desires?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

## Inio Asano: Reflecting Human Behavior with Verisimilitude
[[Takehiko Inoues career and artistic style | Inio Asano]] is known for his realistic settings and characters that mirror human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

His motivations are centered on:
*   **Realism and introspection:** Asano's early works often featured his drawn characters in "hyper realistic settings," reflecting his desire to give insight into ourselves through mundane situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.
*   **Pushing technological boundaries:** With the advent of 3D software, Asano wanted to "spice things up" and use CG as a main character in "Dead Dead Demon's Dededede Destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. Despite the increased time investment, he believed it was "worth it" for the visual possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Mirroring human flaws:** Asano aims for his "bland weird characters to reflect our own impulsive non-rational way that we choose to do things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. His stories, like "Solanin" and "Punpun," aim to show "deeply flawed, hurt, complicated, unreasonable, inconsiderate human beings who can only say that they're trying their best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

## Kentaro Miura: Pure Effort and Emotional Depth
Kentaro Miura, the late author of "Berserk," is widely acknowledged for the "pure effort" invested in his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. His motivations included:
*   **Relentless detail:** Even without digital tools, Miura's early work showed incredible detail, with every line conveying energy and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. For example, a war panel might feature "every horse, every knight, every swordsman has their own unique design and armor set" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.
*   **Pacing and emotional impact:** Miura was confident in his ability to make readers "sit with certain moments," dedicating multiple pages to convey complex emotional interactions, making small moments simmer and resonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Passion for the craft:** Miura's work is seen as "proof of someone who genuinely cares about their craft," willing to "bleed for their story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. The creation process itself was "fun" and "super satisfying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.

## The Irrepressible Instinct
Ultimately, many artists and creators are driven by an "irrepressible instinct of the spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. They embark on difficult journeys, like creating comics with time-consuming techniques or pushing against industry norms, not to "prove everyone wrong or to beat the guy at the top," but simply because they have an idea and the freedom to act upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. This drive is likened to natural phenomena—a fish flopping, a sun setting, or a penguin "waddling to its death"—acting purely out of an intrinsic drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.
