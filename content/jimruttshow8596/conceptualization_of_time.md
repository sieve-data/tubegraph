The conceptualization of time has evolved significantly across different cultures and periods, often influenced by the prevailing technology of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Early forms of timekeeping relied on natural phenomena like sand, wind, and shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Historical Perspectives

### Newtonian Clockwork Universe
The advent of mechanical clocks led to Isaac Newton's "clockwork universe" concept, where time was envisioned as an ultimate, external clock through which the universe moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Newtonian mechanics proposed that time was reversible, meaning processes could work equally well forwards and backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Einstein's Block Universe
Albert Einstein's work on [[Cosmology and SpaceTime Construction | relative time]] introduced the idea of the [[Cosmology and SpaceTime Construction | block universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. In this view, all moments in time exist simultaneously everywhere, and the sensation of passing through time is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This perspective implies that novelty and [[Causality and Free Will in Complex Systems | free will]] do not exist, as all events are already predetermined within this "block" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

Sarah Walker, an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist, regards [[Cosmology and SpaceTime Construction | Einstein's Universe]] as a "dead Universe" due to its lack of inherent directionality, especially concerning phenomena like life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Lee Cronin, a chemist, questions the testability of the block universe concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### The Arrow of Time
The apparent irreversibility of time, often called the "arrow of time," has several proposed explanations:
*   **Thermodynamic Arrow:** Based on the second law of thermodynamics, this suggests that the increase of disorder (entropy) in the universe provides time with a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. A classic example is a dropped egg splattering – the process cannot be reversed naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Lee Cronin argues that if the second law lacks a fundamental basis or mechanism, it becomes a "religious doctrine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Cosmological Arrow:** Related to the universe's expansion from a singularity, this implies a direction from a small, ordered state to a larger, more expanded state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **[[Causality and Free Will in Complex Systems | Causal Arrow]]**: This theory posits that the sequence of causal relationships defines time's direction, as events happen one after another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Sarah Walker notes that irreversibility in this context needs to be an emergent property, requiring mechanisms that cause processes in only one direction, which may involve [[Concept of consciousness | memory]] in complex systems like biological ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Lee Cronin adds that causation itself is evidence of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   **Particle Physics (Kaon Decay):** A rare, irreversible decay of the kaon subatomic particle that breaks CP symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Lee Cronin points out that particle physics already indicates intrinsic asymmetry through CP violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.
*   **Quantum Decoherence:** The collapse of quantum states into classical states may contribute to the apparent arrow of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

A common criticism of traditional [[Theories of consciousness | theories of time]] is that they do not treat time as a property of objects or as having any materiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Assembly Theory: A New Conceptualization of Time

Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin propose [[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]], which fundamentally redefines time by treating it as an object with materiality, embedded in the structure of physical objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Core Principles
[[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]] originated from experimental measurements and seeks to bridge abstract concepts with lab-measurable phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. It proposes that time is an intrinsic physical attribute of an object, captured by the "minimal set of causal pathways" required to make it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. This means objects are extended in time as recursive, hierarchical, modular structures that encode their own [[Concept of consciousness | memory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

The theory measures the "assemblyness" of an object based on two key components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>:
1.  **Number of Parts (Steps):** The shortest number of causal steps required to form an object, allowing for the reuse of components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. A higher number of steps indicates a greater improbability of formation by random chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. This is distinct from traditional complexity measures (like Kolmogorov complexity) which focus on program size or computational complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. [[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]] focuses on the physical process of construction within the universe's laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
2.  **Number of Copies:** The abundance of identical objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. If an object with many parts also exists in many identical copies (e.g., ten identical iPhone 14s), it strongly suggests non-random formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

The **assembly equation** unifies these two components, giving a higher weighting to the assembly index (number of steps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.

### Memory and Selection
A key concept in [[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]] is that beyond a certain level of complexity, memory is crucial for an object's creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. This [[Concept of consciousness | memory]] can be embodied in various forms, such as the deep genetic memory in DNA or the local metabolic memory within a cell, which are prerequisites for building complex organic molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

[[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]] proposes that selection must predate biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>. Complexity does not arise randomly; it is built in steps, with the universe itself creating mechanisms for [[Concept of consciousness | memory]] and selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. Life, in this context, acts as a "selection amplifier," an autocatalytic network with closure that resists entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

The theory suggests a sharp phase transition between non-biotic (inorganic chemistry) and biotic chemistry at a certain assembly threshold (around 13-14 steps, with 15 steps and above strongly indicating biotic origin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. While life can produce low-assembly objects, high-assembly objects require the physics of life (selection) to be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

### Time as Depth
[[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]] views complex objects as having "depth in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. For example, a cell implies a lineage stretching back billions of years, representing the accumulated causal steps and [[Concept of consciousness | memory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. This perspective means that [[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]] is fundamentally incompatible with Einstein's block universe, as it asserts that some things *must* happen before others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>, and that novelty genuinely emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

### Implications

#### [[Theories of consciousness | Philosophy of Consciousness and Choice | Novelty]] and the Expanding Universe
The universe's expansion signifies an increase in available options, meaning more possibilities exist in the future than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. This aligns with [[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]]'s focus on novelty and the building of complexity, which contradicts the static nature of the block universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

#### [[Emergence of Mind | Emergence of Intelligence]] and the Fermi Paradox
[[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]] provides a framework for addressing the Fermi Paradox, which questions the absence of observable extraterrestrial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.
*   **The Great Perceptual Filter:** Sarah Walker suggests that the "great filter" might not be alien extinction, but rather our own undeveloped "technology of perception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. We may not recognize alien life or technology because we lack the physics to understand what life truly is or how technology evolves beyond our current understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. Just as gravitational waves existed for billions of years before we developed the theory and instruments to detect them, alien phenomena might be similarly imperceptible to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.
*   **Technosignatures:** The theory proposes looking for "technosignatures" – evidence of massive technology, such as Dyson shells or other structures that cannot be explained by abiotic or simple biological physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>.
*   **Detecting Complexity Remotely:** Future efforts using telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope could seek complex molecules in exoplanetary atmospheres that exhibit high assembly numbers, indicating the presence of life or technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. This requires developing planetary models based on [[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]] to detect a planet's "memory of past states" and its "structure of evolving complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>.

#### Probability of Life's Evolution
[[Theories of consciousness | Assembly Theory]] shifts the perspective on the probability of life's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. While individual events in Earth's history might seem improbable, the entire causal chain of life is a single, interconnected structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The key question becomes how much selection is required for the transition to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. The theory aims to make predictions about the ease or difficulty of this transition by quantifying the conditions under which it can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>. Until the physics of this transition is solved, bounding the probability of alien life remains speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>. Lee Cronin believes that selection is as fundamental for the [[Emergence of Mind | emergence of biology]] as gravity is for the [[Cosmology and SpaceTime Construction | emergence of stars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">[01:22:46]</a>.
