This article explores various philosophical concepts related to sacredness, spirituality, and the human search for meaning, drawing from a conversation with John Vervaeke.

## The Nature of Relevance and its Connection to Spirituality

Relevance is fundamentally a process, not an entity with a fixed essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This idea is rooted in Wittgenstein's observation that many categories, like "game," lack an Aristotelian essence (a set of necessary and sufficient conditions shared by all members) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. While some scientific categories, like "gold," do have essences (properties that generalize with systematic import) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:07]</a>, relevance does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

Instead, relevance is similar to Darwinian "fittedness" or "fitness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Just as there's no single definition of what makes an organism "fit" (it could be big, small, fast, slow, complex, or simple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>, there's no essence to relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Darwin proposed a universal process, natural selection, by which fittedness is continually redefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Similarly, relevance realization is a dynamic, evolving process, constantly redefining what is relevant without a fixed perfection or final definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. It's a key tool for cognition in a "combinatorically explosive and constantly changing world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

### [[concept_of_the_sacred_in_human_culture | Sacredness]] as Inexhaustibility

The concept of [[concept_of_the_sacred_in_human_culture | sacredness]] can be understood as the "inexhaustibility of our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. This builds on the idea of relevance realization and its deep connection to [[role_of_religion_and_spirituality | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. In spiritual experiences, what is felt as [[concept_of_the_sacred_in_human_culture | sacredness]] is a profound enhancement of one's "relevance realization connectedness" – how one is connected to oneself, others, and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

Given that there's no perfection or finality to this cognitive fittedness, [[concept_of_the_sacred_in_human_culture | sacredness]] isn't found in a static, perfect state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Instead, it's experienced as an ongoing process of discovery and "self-transcendence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. This aligns with the Neoplatonic Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition's notion of *epictasis*, where the sacred is the "ongoing affordance of our continual self-transcendence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. The flow experience, for instance, is characterized by an "ongoing sense of discovery of ever deeping connectedness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

An object or relationship that affords this "ongoing fount of new intelligibility" will be experienced as more meaningful, transformative, and spiritually deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. This "inexhaustibleness" is key to understanding the experience of [[concept_of_the_sacred_in_human_culture | sacredness]], distinguishing it from trivial experiences that can be easily "finished out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_symbols_and_sacredness_in_cultural_meaning | The Role of Symbols and Cultural Meaning]]

[[the_role_of_symbols_and_sacredness_in_cultural_meaning | Symbols]], in a rich, literary sense (beyond Peirce's icon, index, symbol) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>, are "culturally and cognitively indispensable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:05]</a>. This means a symbol can be crucial for an individual's or culture's cognitive agency, similar to how language is indispensable for a monolingual person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. However, indispensable does not mean "metaphysically necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. Just because English is indispensable to one person's cognition doesn't mean all cognitive agents must speak English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

This distinction is crucial: while people may feel they "can't live without" certain [[the_role_of_symbols_and_sacredness_in_cultural_meaning | symbols]], validating their personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>, it does not license the conclusion that "everybody needs this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. Conflating cultural indispensability with metaphysical necessity is a common pitfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>, leading to the loading of "metaphysical claptrap" onto useful cultural artifacts, as seen in the evolution of Buddhism after Gautama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.

## [[the_concept_of_religio_and_secular_wonder | The Concept of Religio]] and Perennial Problems

[[the_concept_of_religio_and_secular_wonder | Religio]] is defined as "the realization... of the fundamental connectedness fittedness that is at the core of our cognitive agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. This realization encompasses connectedness to oneself (as autopoietic beings), to others (as sociocultural beings), and to the world (as dynamically evolving cognitive systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. It's a positive, motivationally and functionally beneficial experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>.

[[the_concept_of_religio_and_secular_wonder | Religio]] is central to addressing what are called "perennial problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. These are inherent vulnerabilities in human cognition that lead to self-deceptive and self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Modal confusion**: Confusing the "being mode" (experiential presence) and the "having mode" (possessing and controlling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>.
*   **Absurdity**: The clash between cosmic and local perspectives, where the former can undermine the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.
*   **Alienation**: The tension between individuation and participation in groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.
*   **Parasitic processing**: Self-deceptive and self-destructive patterns of thought and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>.

These problems can lead to feelings of despair and disconnectedness, making reality seem "thin and vaporous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>. [[the_concept_of_religio_and_secular_wonder | Religio]] helps us escape these problems by fostering connectedness and allowing our inherent relevance realization to be guided in healthy ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

## The "Religion of No Religion"

The "religion of no religion" (RNR) is a proposed framework that seeks to address the meaning crisis without relying on outdated "two-worlds mythologies" or traditional religious doctrines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. It aims for a proper theoretical integration of cognitive science and a "reverse engineering of enlightenment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

The RNR proposes to:
*   **Exact from the past**: Respectfully draw on effective practices and wisdom from existing philosophical and religious traditions, while leaving behind their "decadent two-worlds mythologies and metaphysics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>.
*   **Integrate with science**: Be compatible with a scientific "one-world worldview," acknowledging the multi-level complexity of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.
*   **Cultivate wisdom**: Offer a coherent and collective way to cultivate wisdom, ameliorate foolishness, and afford flourishing, especially for those who find traditional religions irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.

### Credo, Mythos, and Religio

The RNR emphasizes a dynamic relationship between three core elements:
1.  **[[the_concept_of_religio_and_secular_wonder | Religio]]**: The core experience of connectedness and cognitive fittedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Credo**: The use of propositions and conceptual frameworks to distinguish genuine transformation from madness or self-deception, akin to "setting the criterion" in signal detection theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Any particular credo is *not* metaphysically necessary, and should constantly evolve and self-correct to better serve [[the_concept_of_religio_and_secular_wonder | religio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>. The problem with traditional religions is often "creedal tyranny," where belief becomes central and rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
3.  **[[concepts_of_metaphysics_and_storytelling | Mythos]]**: The use of rich [[the_role_of_symbols_and_sacredness_in_cultural_meaning | symbols]], stories, rituals, and celebrations to imaginally augment and enhance the realization of [[the_concept_of_religio_and_secular_wonder | religio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. [[concepts_of_metaphysics_and_storytelling | Mythos]] helps align different kinds of knowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>. Critically, [[concepts_of_metaphysics_and_storytelling | mythos]] should serve [[the_concept_of_religio_and_secular_wonder | religio]] and be wary of merging with a rigid credo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>.

The RNR envisions a constant feedback loop: `religio` serves as an "experiment in applied credo," providing mechanisms for adjusting credo to make `religio` better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>. This mirrors the self-correcting nature of science and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.

## Reverse Engineering Enlightenment and Cultivating Wisdom

Instead of relying on historical or cross-cultural claims of enlightenment, Vervaeke proposes "reverse engineering enlightenment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This means setting the goal as "overcoming the perennial problems and enhancing [[the_concept_of_religio_and_secular_wonder | religio]] in a way that's wise and transformatively effective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. Then, using cognitive science, one can reliably and systematically ameliorate problems and foster flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. This approach aims to make enlightenment "ultimately realizable by human beings in a lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>, stripping away mystique and metaphysical claims that render it unattainable for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

### Ecologies of Psychotechnologies

A core component of this reverse engineering is cultivating "ecologies of psychotechnologies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:46">[01:29:46]</a>. These are dynamical systems of practices that leverage complementary strengths and weaknesses through "opponent processing" to achieve massive recursive self-correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. Examples of psychotechnologies include:
*   Meditation and contemplative practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>
*   Yoga, Tai Chi, and other mind-body practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>
*   Medical psychotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>
*   Psychedelic drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>
*   Neuro/biofeedback, transcranial stimulation, brain implants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>
*   Group singing, chanting, ecstatic dancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>

The goal is to intentionally craft and coordinate these practices within communities to ameliorate foolishness and enhance flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. This also connects to `cyber technologies` and raises a moral obligation to guide their use towards wisdom, counteracting "bad faith actors" who might use them for nefarious purposes, such as creating emotionless soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>.

### Wisdom, Rationality, and Virtue

The proper use of psychotechnologies requires the development of [[ethics_and_metaphysics | wisdom]] and "meta-virtue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:37">[01:35:37]</a>. While intelligence (g) may be relatively fixed, rationality is highly malleable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>. Intelligence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:21">[01:43:21]</a>.

[[ethics_and_metaphysics | Wisdom]] is crucial for making people "more insightfully rational and more rationally insightful in a systematic and systemic way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:14">[01:37:14]</a>. This includes:
*   **Insight**: The "systematic seeing through illusion and into reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.
*   **Active Open-mindedness**: A cognitive style that involves deliberately seeking evidence to disconfirm one's own propositions, and actively counteracting cognitive biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:56">[01:45:56]</a>. A key practice is "steel manning" an opponent's argument – formulating it as strongly as possible, even if one disagrees, and then trying to move towards that position with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:36">[01:47:36]</a>. This fosters "dialogical movement" and "real thinking," leading to shared insights neither party could have reached alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>.
*   **Epistemic Humility**: Acknowledging the vastness of one's own ignorance, even about seemingly simple objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:53">[01:46:53]</a>.
*   **Virtues in Science**: Scientists need intellectual virtues like balancing humility with courage, being open to self-correction while boldly proposing hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a>.

By cultivating these aspects, humanity can pursue a form of [[relevance_of_spirituality_and_altered_states_in_metamodernism | spirituality]] that is deeply respectable, transformatively effective, and continuously evolving in alignment with scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a>.
