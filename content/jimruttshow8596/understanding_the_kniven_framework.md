The [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | Cynefin framework]], created by Dave Snowden, originated from his work in Knowledge Management at IBM, specifically while looking at informal and formal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Over time, it evolved into a [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | complexity]] and form framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Core Principles
The framework operates on the fundamental principle that there are three primary types of systems: ordered, complex, and chaotic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. It acknowledges that phase shifts occur between these states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Solid, Liquid, Gas Metaphor
Snowden often uses the metaphor of solid, liquid, and gas to illustrate these system states and their phase shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This metaphor also introduces the concept of a "triple point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, where something is equiprobable of becoming solid, liquid, or gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### The Apparatic Domain
In the [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | Cynefin framework]], this triple point is called the "apparatic domain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. The term "apparatic," known to every Greek school child but less so in the West, signifies a question that can only be answered by thinking differently about the problem; it cannot be straightforwardly answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Apparatic moments are crucial in a crisis, pushing people into a state where they cannot rely on previous ways of seeing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

The framework further divides the "ordered" domain into two sub-categories: clear and complicated, and also incorporates the concept of liminality, making it a three-level framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## Complex vs. Complicated Systems
A key distinction within the [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | Cynefin framework]] and in [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | applied complexity science]] is between the complex and the complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Complicated**: Derives from the Latin root "to unfold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. A complicated system can be unfolded and folded, remaining the same thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. It can typically be taken apart and reassembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, as its logic is implicit in the design's statics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a> (e.g., a lawnmower motor or a Boeing 777 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>). Human beings are good at making things complicated to achieve predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Complex**: Originates from the Greek root "entangled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. A complex system is constantly shifting and changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. It cannot be taken apart and put back together to work the same way, as much of the information is in its dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a> (e.g., a human cell or an economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>). When a complex system is mistakenly assumed to be complicated, radical errors occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. A complex system is like bramble bushes in a thicket, where everything is entangled, and unintended consequences are certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## Causality and Emergence in Complex Adaptive Systems
In a [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | complex adaptive system]], there is no linear material causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. While such a system has dispositionality and is modulated, it lacks causality in any meaningful sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. This is why it offers a radically different way of viewing the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. Even deterministic complex systems often pass through deterministic chaos, making cause and effect impractical to map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

The properties of the whole are always different from the properties of the part, as seen in superconductors where electron behavior doesn't predict the emergent superconductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Discovering [[Metamodernism as a philosophical framework | emergence]] is a key aspect of working with [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

## Constraints
Constraints are crucial in Snowden's lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **Enabling vs. Governing Constraints**: An important distinction is made between enabling constraints and governing constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Ordered systems are generally governed (contained), whereas complex systems are connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
*   **Boundaries vs. Connectivity**: Most systems thinkers define systems by boundaries, but from a [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | complexity]] perspective, everything is connected, and connectivity matters more than boundaries within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.
*   **Managing Constraints**: Constraints can be mapped and changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. One cannot control the output of a complex system; instead, one must describe the current state and identify what can be done next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This aligns with the "next right thing" concept and the [[concepts_from_deep_survival | adjacent possible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Knowing which constraints are in play allows for their management and thus influences [[Metamodernism as a philosophical framework | emergence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Modulators**: Constraints and Constructors are the two main types of modulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. Mapping these is the critical first step in managing a complex system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. The more modulators controlled, and with real-time feedback, the more influence one has over the system's outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

## Open Systems
[[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | Complex systems]] are regarded as inherently open, or at least semi-permeable, to an outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. At the system level, they are not subject to the second law of thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional systems thinking, which often defines systems with boundaries, implying a closed nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Human systems, in particular, may exhibit short-term teleological cause, capable of generating energy in unforeseen ways as the system develops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

## Application in Crisis Management
The [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | Cynefin framework]] gained significant traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, shifting its market from early adopters to early majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. The understanding of [[complex_adaptive_systems_and_the_cynefin_framework | complexity]] helps manage "unknowable unknowns" – things that cannot be known until they happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

Key actions suggested in a crisis using the framework include:
1.  **Building Informal Networks**: Humans rely on informal networks for decisions in a crisis, not formal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>. This involves rapidly building dense informal networks across silos, for instance, through methods like "entangled trios," which focuses on knowledge flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>.
2.  **Mapping Knowledge at the Right Granularity**: Knowledge needs to be stored at a level of granularity that allows it to be repurposed quickly for novel situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>, a concept known as [[Metamodernism as a philosophical framework | exaptation]] in evolutionary biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>. The "right level" is achieved by breaking down an issue until agreement can be reached on its placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:08:00">[32:08:00]</a>.
3.  **Setting Draconian Constraints**: In a crisis, leaders must act decisively and quickly to stabilize the situation, not necessarily to solve the problem directly, but to increase options for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a>. This involves making "option-increasing decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>.
4.  **Comprehensive Journaling (Gamba)**: Advocating for continuous journaling instead of traditional reporting, which provides real-time, fine-grained data from multiple agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>. This approach reduces time burden on individuals and provides better data for organizations, supporting anticipatory alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:36:00">[40:36:00]</a>. Such journaling also allows for "lessons learning" in real time, rather than relying on delayed "lessons learned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>.
5.  **Creating Specialized Crews**: Forming focused, collective crews (e.g., continuity crew, journaling crew, devil's advocate crew) based on roles and role interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:43:00">[48:43:00]</a>. These specialized crews can possess emergent intelligence greater than the sum of their individual members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:18:00">[49:18:00]</a>.
6.  **Maintaining Cadence and Control**: During emergence from crisis, maintaining a consistent rhythm (cadence) is vital. It allows for sustained progress and adaptation through continuous use of sensor networks, informal networks, and distributed knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

## Strategic Interventions with Narrative Topographies
Instead of traditional strategy focusing on future goals, the framework emphasizes mapping the present and identifying the "adjacent possible" – where one can go next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. This is achieved by gathering micro-scenarios from the workforce, using the information to create "narrative topographies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. These topographies are used for cultural, safety, and attitude mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

By asking questions like "what can I do tomorrow to create more stories like these and fewer stories like those?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>, the framework supports a [[frameworks_for_new_social_operating_systems | fractal representation]] of data, allowing different levels of an organization to derive relevant actions from the same source data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. This approach shifts focus from outcome management to "dispositional management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

## Connection to Constructor Theory
Snowden's work is extending to apply [[frameworks_for_new_social_operating_systems | Constructor Theory]], a physics theory that focuses on enumerating what is impossible rather than the rules of what is doable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This is manifested in "Esterline mapping," which plots constraints on a grid based on the energy cost of change and the time to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.
*   **Counterfactual Line**: A "counterfactual line" denotes actions that are too costly in energy or time to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.
*   **Liminal Line**: A "liminal line" indicates things that cannot be changed by the current entity but might be changeable by someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Dispositional Management**: The goal is to perform micro-actions to change the dispositionality of the system, making desired outcomes more probable and undesired outcomes less so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>. This implies making "the energy cost of virtue less than the energy cost of sin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.

In human systems, a "Constructor" is something that produces a transformation as things pass through it or contact it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a>, and unlike in physics, these constructors can change in the act of construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. Counterfactuals also relate to people's feelings as much as physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>. The fundamental principle is to establish what cannot change, knowing that whatever has the lowest energy gradient will prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:59">[01:22:59]</a>. This concept echoes catalysis, where actions reduce the activation energy for desirable changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.
