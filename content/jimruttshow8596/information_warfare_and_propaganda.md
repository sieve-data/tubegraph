The Jim Rutt Show features an episode dedicated to the topic of [[role_of_network_warfare_in_modern_conflicts | information warfare]] and propaganda, particularly as discussed in two recent essays from The Consilience Project [00:02:05]. This focus aims to help listeners understand the nature of propaganda to foster a better information ecosystem [00:02:27].

## The Scale and Scope of Modern Information Warfare

[[role_of_network_warfare_in_modern_conflicts | Information warfare]] has a long and complex history, dating back to ancient times with examples like Sun Tzu's writings or the obelisks of Ramses I [00:03:13]. These early forms of [[role_of_network_warfare_in_modern_conflicts | information warfare]] were always constrained by the available communication media [00:03:30]. For instance, on D-Day, hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were scattered to instill fear in opposing enemies [00:03:52].

A significant shift occurred during the Cold War with the institution of psychological warfare under Eisenhower [00:04:13]. This involved not just printing presses and radio, but also television, a large academic apparatus, and the entertainment industry [00:04:27]. Figures like Edward Bernays rebranded these multi-pronged approaches as "public relations" [00:04:36]. This era saw the widespread institutionalization of manipulative communication habits [00:04:48]. The behavioral sciences gained supremacy as an aspect of the military-industrial complex, leading to widespread efforts to create increasingly sophisticated mechanisms for manipulative communication [00:05:10].

Today, all sides in the [[role_of_network_warfare_in_modern_conflicts | information war]] possess such powerful informational weapons that they should be considered akin to weapons of mass destruction [00:05:33]. The current landscape, inundated with competing propaganda campaigns, is being destroyed to such an extent that no one can truly win the "culture war" [00:05:42]. This situation is likened to a "self-terminating war" of "mutually assured destruction" due to the escalating sophistication of informational warfare [00:05:53]. The destruction of populations' capacities to collaborate and make choices is a major consequence [00:07:10].

This escalation is largely due to two simultaneous trends: the ever-increasing reach of mass media and the massive increase in real knowledge of [[Media Influence and Cognitive Science | psychology and cognitive science]] [00:07:56]. The potential for future technologies like pervasive virtual and augmented reality could elevate [[role_of_network_warfare_in_modern_conflicts | information warfare]] from "Hiroshima bombs" to "hydrogen bombs," threatening advanced civilization [00:09:05].

### Elites and Susceptibility to Propaganda

A crucial point is that no group of leaders is immune to the cognitive and emotional distortions inflicted upon the masses [00:09:34]. Once manipulative information is unleashed, it pollutes the entire environment, including the elites who initiated it [00:09:45]. Governments incentivize the creation of experts in deception and manipulation, leading to a bureaucracy that undermines trust among its own agencies [00:10:38]. This can lead to paranoia within the insulated political class, and younger generations entering this class may have been socialized in a completely propagandized environment [01:11:15].

The influence of [[impact_of_social_media_on_information_dissemination | social media]] and micro-targeted attention capture technology means that even if one doesn't actively "buy" the propaganda they produce, they are still susceptible if they spend any time on these platforms [01:11:43]. Research supports that more educated and intelligent individuals are often more susceptible to confirmation bias [01:13:36].

The deep history of sophisticated, psychologically manipulative [[role_of_network_warfare_in_modern_conflicts | information warfare]] can lead to suspicion of everything, making it difficult to find reliable information even about past government propaganda activities [01:14:10]. This creates a problem where counter-propaganda merely becomes competing propagandas without a valid foundation [01:15:14].

### Mass Insanity and Information Nihilism

The current state of society is described as "teetering on the edge of mass insanity," caught in dynamics of mutual assured destruction [01:16:20]. This "mass insanity" manifests as ubiquitous low-grade psychopathology [01:16:49]. Historical examples show that a culture's level of pathology and neurosis makes it susceptible to propaganda, and propaganda itself induces more neurosis and psychopathology, creating a negative feedback loop [01:17:11]. The pandemic, for instance, saw a tremendous increase in mental health problems alongside a surge in propaganda [01:17:32].

Insanity can also be defined as the absence of contact with reality [01:18:19]. This ties into Baudrillardian simulation, where civilizations create illusions to sustain themselves, drawing populations into fictitious understandings of their actual situation [01:18:25]. This leads to a state of "information nihilism," where one doesn't care whether what they say is true or false, only if it is useful [01:19:10]. This can devolve into sociopathy, where the increasing weaponization of language fuels conflict [01:19:40]. Harry Frankfurt's distinction between lying (which depends on truth) and "bullshitting" (which doesn't care about truth or lies) is relevant here [01:20:21]. Both the left and right tend to accuse the other side of operating in bad faith, a sign of a deeply propagandized environment where language is provided to dehumanize opponents [01:21:04].

### Distinguishing Education from Propaganda

The distinction between [[Education vs Propaganda | education and propaganda]] is crucial. One common misconception is that anything one agrees with is [[Education vs Propaganda | education]], and anything one disagrees with is propaganda, regardless of method [01:25:50]. This flawed analysis prevents people from realizing their own communication practices might be counterproductive [01:26:55]. Another confusion is the belief that no difference exists between the two, leading to epistemological nihilism where all communication is seen as manipulative [01:27:21]. However, manipulative communication is parasitic on non-manipulative communication; basic human development and socialization require honest conversation and mutual understanding [01:28:07].

To distinguish, one must look at the structure of the relationship and communication patterns, rather than just the content [01:29:07].

Two key indicators:

1.  **Epistemic Asymmetry:** Both the propagandist and the educator typically know more than the audience, creating an "epistemic asymmetry" [01:29:57].
    *   **Propaganda:** There is no intention for the audience to "graduate" or ascend to the propagandist's level of knowledge [01:30:13]. The intention is to control behavior through information manipulation, maintaining an unbridgeable epistemic gap [01:30:57].
    *   **Education:** The entire point of the educator's communication is to obsolete this asymmetry, bringing the student to a position of knowing what the educator knows, and even beyond, fostering responsibility for knowledge and societal handling [01:30:31].

2.  **Nature and Style of Communication:**
    *   **Propaganda:** Often involves applications of behavioral psychological insight to manipulate stimulation and communication [01:31:56]. Messages are designed to be receivable under duress, sensory overwhelm, phobia, indoctrination, double binds, and fatigue [01:32:10]. Digital media, like TikTok, can induce such states, making viewers malleable, susceptible, and emotionally manipulable [01:32:26]. The intent is attention capture and influencing behavior, sometimes akin to brainwashing [01:35:27].
    *   **Education:** The educator is concerned with the audience being in the right state to be reflective and integrate new knowledge in a non-disruptive way. The educator wants the audience to have their wits about them to work on problems [01:32:41].

A non-falsifiable system is a strong tell for propaganda [01:36:51]. If questioning a doctrine or idea leads to immediate dismissal as a "heretic" or "racist" (as with Critical Race Theory), it indicates a propagandistic agenda [01:37:02]. Propaganda often creates and relies on "thought-terminating clichés" (Robert Lifton's term), like "the science is settled," which are designed to shut down further conversation and protect an underlying, often incoherent, ideology [01:38:35].

## Types of Propaganda

Inspired by Jacques Ellul's work, the article outlines several typologies:

1.  **Overt vs. Covert Propaganda:**
    *   **Overt:** Everyone knows it's propaganda and who made it, like Uncle Sam posters, Nazi rallies, or the national anthem at a football game [01:41:51]. It's the most transparent kind [01:42:42].
    *   **Covert:** The audience doesn't realize it's propaganda [01:43:00]. Examples include the CIA's secret financial and operational support for student protest groups in the 1960s to promote a "protest culture" image abroad [01:43:06]. Another example is Russian propaganda on Facebook during the 2016 election, where users unknowingly consumed content created by foreign intelligence operatives [01:44:20]. Distinguishing covert propaganda is a critical 21st-century skill [01:44:57].

2.  **Deceitful vs. Truthful but Misleading Propaganda:**
    *   **Deceitful:** Involves outright lies or crazy disinformation campaigns, often from foreign governments [01:46:04]. However, this is a short-term strategy as it risks a "boy who cried wolf" effect when discovered [01:47:09].
    *   **Truthful but Misleading:** Great propagandists use as much truthful information as possible, but selectively, to create a specific picture [01:46:39]. Goebbels, for example, advised telling the truth but not the whole truth [01:46:47]. This allows for plausible deniability of fiction [01:48:42]. This type of propaganda can pass fact-checkers because it doesn't contain factual inaccuracies, but it omits crucial context, leading to a deceptive understanding [01:49:05]. Ideologically motivated think tanks often operate this way, pursuing specific research agendas while omitting others [01:50:39]. The belief that [[impact_of_social_media_on_information_dissemination | information problems]] can be solved by simple fact-checking or by removing "liars" misunderstands the complexity of manipulative information [01:51:32].

3.  **Vertical vs. Horizontal Propaganda:**
    *   **Vertical:** Classic, centralized, top-down propaganda, usually government-run and aided by intelligence agencies [01:52:19]. Examples include state-directed campaigns like those from the Russian Internet Research Agency [01:52:54].
    *   **Horizontal:** Has no centralized authority. It is created, embraced, improved upon, and spread by the very people who were initially targeted by vertical propaganda [01:53:27]. This taps into psychological motivations, leading people to become "true believers" and propagate thought-terminating clichés [01:53:41]. Jimi Hendrix playing the Star-Spangled Banner at Woodstock is cited as a powerful example of horizontal propaganda for American ideals of freedom [01:54:07]. The rise of [[impact_of_social_media_on_information_dissemination | social media]] has greatly accelerated horizontal propagation [01:55:27].
    *   **Emergent Propaganda:** [[role_of_network_power_and_social_media_in_modern_warfare | Social media]] can also lead to emergent propaganda, where "mind viruses" or memes spin up organically in the "petri dish of horizontal culture," gaining coherence and becoming self-generated engines [01:55:37]. The drastically lowered barrier to access the [[role_of_network_warfare_in_modern_conflicts | information war]] means individuals can create propaganda as powerful as government campaigns, leading to a spiraling [[asymmetric_warfare_and_defense_strategies | arms race]] where traditional vertical strategies fail and create more problems than they solve [01:56:20].

## The COVID-19 Pandemic as a Case Study

The COVID-19 pandemic provides a curious case study for propaganda dynamics [01:58:54]. The CDC's early, false claim that masks were ineffective, intended to prevent panic and conserve limited supplies, seeded a culture of backlash against masks [01:59:02]. This was an attempt at a "noble lie" via vertical propaganda, a strategy that might have worked in the 1980s when communication resources were limited [01:59:29]. However, in the current digital landscape, such attempts create "eddies that spiral out of counter-propaganda" [02:00:11]. This undermines the legitimacy of official pronouncements and reveals the ingrained belief among governing classes that they cannot reason with people [02:00:36].

The inability to access raw data from vaccine companies, coupled with their lack of accountability for negative health outcomes, creates an "unbridgeable epistemic asymmetry" [01:06:36]. While the FDA acts as a proxy, it too operates with a similar epistemic gap and lacks direct accountability, further eroding trust [01:10:20]. This makes it impossible for the relationship to be truly educational; it becomes persuasive or coercive [01:09:50]. The refusal to provide public data and take responsibility drives counter-propaganda, leading to ambient cynicism and information nihilism, where "my idiot uncle" is perceived as equally likely to be true as a scholar [01:12:06].

### The Nudge and its Propagandistic Nature

The concept of "nudging," popularized by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, is a newer form of propaganda [01:04:04]. Nudging units, often connected to behavioral scientists and digital media companies, attempt to set choice architectures that influence decisions without the individual's awareness [01:04:29]. An example is making enrollment in a retirement plan a default "yes" rather than "no" [01:05:03]. This is a form of covert propaganda, even if seemingly benign in its intent [01:04:48].

## Towards a Solution: Rebuilding Social Coherence

To address the destructive nature of [[role_of_network_warfare_in_modern_conflicts | information warfare]], society needs to establish "demilitarized zones" where [[Education vs Propaganda | education]] can occur instead of conflict [02:22:05]. This resilience begins at the level of family, socialization, and community cultural resilience [02:22:41]. Instead of schools, which are often battlegrounds in culture wars, the focus should be on creating contexts where individuals can be sure of good faith communication and expand these contexts [02:23:00]. This is similar to the concept of decentralized education hub networks that are non-parochial yet digitally networked [02:23:51].

The goal is not insulation but creating new conditions for socialization where individuals can discern between information warfare and genuine educational relationships [02:24:39]. Being able to discern propaganda from [[Education vs Propaganda | education]] is one of the most valuable skills for a human to possess today [02:25:11].

Exponential digital technologies have rendered traditional ways of running states, economies, and cultures obsolete [02:20:01]. There are three paths forward:
1.  **Authoritarian Order:** Using digital means to establish a centralized view and social control system, like China, making vertical propaganda effective again [02:20:23]. This is a self-terminating pattern [02:21:11].
2.  **Cultural Chaos:** The current situation, where the internet fuels escalating, polarized feedback dynamics, leading to complete cultural, economic, and political chaos [02:21:19]. This could eventually lead to techno-feudalism, which is also self-terminating [02:21:40].
3.  **Ordered Open Structure (Education Infrastructure):** Using digital affordances to create a fundamentally different civic architecture—a broadly distributed educational and communications architecture that enables deliberative democracy [02:21:51]. This involves designing an "open structure for the digital" [02:23:02].

Technical solutions are part of this, such as requiring real-name identity online (with narrow exceptions) to reduce bots, AI-generated texts, and anonymous advertisers, creating a "cleaner" digital space [02:23:54]. Beyond technology, the focus must be on using technology to create new forms of embodied communication and foster civic discourse [02:24:07]. Educational technology should not keep people on screens but connect them to others who can benefit from communication [02:24:48].

The ultimate goal is to leverage the [[role_of_network_power_and_social_media_in_modern_warfare | network power]] of the digital to galvanize "noetic polities"—groups committed to values that can build education, community, and conversation [02:24:55]. This contrasts with current platforms that create market demographic groups and propagandized subclasses [02:25:15].

A critical societal challenge is how individuals can intelligently choose experts to trust, given the complexity of modern knowledge [02:26:00]. While direct access to raw data may be impractical for many, systems for "inter-subjective inter-objective validation" within a transparent expert proxy chain could build social coherence and trust [02:26:51]. This would move beyond simply accepting official pronouncements or succumbing to information nihilism [02:27:00].

This ties into concepts of "educational democracy" or "qualified democracy," where individuals can choose to delegate decisions to experts, but critically, the educational "on-ramp" to expertise and full information must not be guarded [02:27:20].

Finally, the immense technological prowess currently used to make algorithms for addiction and attention capture could be repurposed [02:30:52]. Imagine algorithms dedicated to showing people sequences of information that lead to healthy, mature, and capable minds, fostering [[integrated_information_theory | human development]], hierarchical complexity, and reflective metacognitive awareness [02:31:01]. This would be a radical shift from profit-driven exploitation to an educational social control that is non-coercive, allowing for cooperation and collaboration in times of crisis [02:32:56]. This vision of a "profound educational infrastructure" relies on the faith that education can lead people towards truth, reducing conflict and division [02:33:35].
