Dr. Rhonda Patrick, a PhD, has devoted her life to studying the aging process and disease prevention, seeking new modalities that may affect longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. She presented on the potential for sauna bathing to become a standard of care in the next 10 years for preventing and treating various cardiovascular-related conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Her talk focused on how sauna use can help stave off the aging process and lead to a longer, healthier life, particularly due to its robust effect on [[sauna_use_and_cardiovascular_health_benefits | cardiovascular health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Overall Health and Mortality

Emerging and compelling research over the past few decades, including observational studies, prospective studies, interventional trials, and mechanistic studies, suggests that sauna bathing improves overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### The Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study
The largest prospective studies on sauna use have originated from Eastern Finland, utilizing a cohort from the ongoing *Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This study, which began in the 1980s, follows thousands of men and women for decades to examine various diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

One study, published in *JAMA Internal Medicine*, focused on approximately 2,300 men with at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor and examined the effect of sauna bathing on [[impact_of_sauna_use_on_longevity_and_allcause_mortality | longevity]] and various cardiovascular diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Key findings from this study regarding mortality:
*   **Sudden Cardiac Death**:
    *   Men using the sauna 2-3 times a week had a 22% lower risk of sudden cardiac death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   Men using the sauna 4-7 times a week had a 63% lower risk of sudden cardiac death compared to those using it once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This showed a dose-dependent effect based on frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   Spending at least 11 minutes in the sauna was associated with about a 7% lower risk of sudden cardiac death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   Spending at least 19 minutes (20 minutes) in the sauna led to about a 50% reduction in sudden cardiac death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Duration was also critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   Data was adjusted for confounding factors such as cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, socioeconomic status, and physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

*   **Coronary Heart Disease Related Death & Fatal Cardiovascular Mortality**:
    *   Using the sauna 2-3 times a week resulted in a 23% lower coronary heart disease-related death risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   Using the sauna 4-7 times a week increased this reduction to about 43% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
    *   For fatal cardiovascular mortality, sauna use 2-3 times a week was associated with a 24-27% lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Sauna use 4-7 times a week was linked to a 50% lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. These also showed a dose-dependent effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

*   **Stroke Risk**:
    *   The Kuopio study also found that sauna use positively affected stroke risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   Using the sauna 2-3 times a week was associated with a 14% lower stroke risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   Using the sauna 4-7 times a week resulted in about a 60% lower stroke risk in both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

*   **Hypertension**:
    *   [[Sauna use and cardiovascular health benefits | Hypertension]] has been repeatedly and consistently shown to be affected by sauna use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   A dose-dependent effect was observed, with 4-7 times a week use showing the most robust effect, leading to about a 50% reduction in hypertension risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
    *   Even a single 30-minute Finnish sauna exposure can lower blood pressure and improve arterial compliance (the ability of blood vessels to expand and contract) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **All-Cause Mortality**:
    *   The Kuopio study also looked at [[impact_of_sauna_use_on_longevity and allcause mortality | all-cause mortality]], which includes deaths from cancer, respiratory infections, and other causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
    *   Men using the sauna 2-3 times a week had a 27% lower risk of all-cause mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   This risk was 40% lower for men using the sauna 4-7 times a week compared to those using it once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

*   **Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia**:
    *   [[Role of sauna use in reducing Alzheimers and dementia risk | Sauna use]] has been associated with a lower risk of [[role_of_sauna_use_in_reducing_alzheimers_and_dementia_risk | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
    *   Men using a sauna 2-3 times a week had a 20% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
    *   Those using it 4-7 times a week saw a 60% lower risk of Alzheimer's and similar reduction for dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Vascular health, important for the heart, is also crucial for brain health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Types of Saunas and Usage

*   **Finnish Sauna**: Most studies cited used a Finnish sauna, which is a wet sauna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. It uses hot water thrown on rocks to increase humidity, making the sauna feel hotter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   Typical temperature: around 174°F (79°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   Humidity: up to about 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   Duration: Greater than 19 minutes (at least 20 minutes) is key for robust effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    *   Frequency: 2-3 times a week shows significant effects, while 4-7 times a week provides even stronger benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

*   **Waon Therapy (Far Infrared Ray Saunas)**: This type of sauna uses far infrared rays to directly heat the body, rather than the ambient air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   Typical temperature: around 140°F (60°C), not as hot as Finnish saunas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   Duration: Typically longer, about 45 minutes, compared to 20 minutes for Finnish saunas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   Frequency: Often daily for 2-3 weeks in most studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   Studies have shown Waon therapy can improve endurance, heart size, and disease status in chronic heart failure patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, and improve vascular endothelial function in patients with ischemic heart disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Action: Overlap with Exercise

The [[mechanisms_behind_sauna_benefits_on_cardiovascular_health | beneficial effects of heat stress]] on the cardiovascular system largely overlap with the physiological responses to physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

When in a sauna:
1.  Skin temperature increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
2.  Blood flow shifts from organs to the skin (50-70% redistribution) to facilitate sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
3.  Heart rate increases up to 150 beats per minute, equivalent to moderate physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
4.  Stroke volume remains the same, but cardiac output increases by 60-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

A study in *Complementary Therapies of Medicine* found that a 25-minute sauna session had identical effects on heart rate and blood pressure as a 25-minute stationary bike session at 100 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Both activities increased heart rate and blood pressure *during* the session, and *immediately after*, both heart rate and blood pressure were lower than baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

Sauna also impacts the autonomic nervous system similarly to physical activity, improving heart rate variability (HRV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. A single 30-minute Finnish sauna session can lower heart rate, increase HRV, and boost parasympathetic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Increased HRV indicates a better capacity for the heart to respond favorably under stressful conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Long-term sauna use has been shown to improve blood pressure, left ventricular function, vascular compliance, and endothelial function, all of which are also improved by physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)
Heat stress is one of the most robust ways to increase the expression and activity of chaperone proteins called heat shock proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. HSPs are evolutionarily conserved and found in many organisms, including humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

*   **Function**: HSPs are crucial for maintaining the proper three-dimensional structure of proteins inside cells, which is vital for protein function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. They help prevent damage to protein structure, which can occur from normal aging, metabolism byproducts, and reactive oxygen species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **Protein Aggregation**: When protein structure is damaged, proteins may not degrade properly and can aggregate, forming plaques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Protein aggregates play a causal role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (amyloid-beta), Parkinson's (alpha-synuclein), and Huntington's (Huntington protein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. They are also implicated in cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. HSPs play a pivotal role in preventing and even negating this aggregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Muscular Atrophy**: HSPs have been shown to slow muscular atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. A recent study found that individuals whose legs were immobilized for weeks, but were exposed to heat, showed increased HSPs in muscle biopsies and were 37% less likely to experience muscle atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Human Longevity**: Humans with a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the HSP70 gene that functionally improves the chaperone protein's ability to maintain protein structure, tend to live longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Those with two copies of this SNP live, on average, two years longer, and those with one copy live about one year longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Boosting HSPs**: Healthy individuals sitting in a dry sauna at about 163°F (73°C) for 30 minutes can increase their HSPs by 50%, with levels remaining elevated for about 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. People who are heat acclimated (frequent sauna users or physically active) can increase their HSPs sooner and more robustly upon heat stress exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

### Lowering Inflammation
Chronic inflammation plays a major role in the aging process and age-related diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   Sauna use has been consistently shown to lower C-reactive protein (an inflammatory biomarker) in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
*   It also increases anti-inflammatory biomarkers like IL-10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, similar to the effects of physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

## Other Longevity and Health Benefits
*   **Brain Function and Mood**: Sauna use positively affects brain function and increases endorphins, similar to physical activity, leading to a mood-enhancing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. One randomized controlled trial found that a single session elevating core body temperature by 1-2 degrees had an antidepressant effect lasting weeks for people with major depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.
*   **Detoxification**: Certain heavy metals like cadmium and mercury are better excreted through sweat than through urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

## Safety and Compliance
Sauna use is generally very safe for healthy individuals and those with stable cardiac disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Rehydration**: It is crucial to rehydrate after sauna use, as a person typically loses about 0.5 kilograms (1.1 lbs) of sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
*   **Contraindications**:
    *   Alcohol: Never use alcohol before or during sauna use, as there have been case reports of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
    *   Elderly individuals prone to low blood pressure, due to the significant blood pressure lowering effect of saunas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.
    *   Individuals with recent myocardial infarction, severe angina pectoris, or severe aortic stenosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
    *   Children: While saunas are used by children in Finland, their duration should be much shorter (e.g., 5 minutes) compared to adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. Specific guidance for special populations is available on Dr. Patrick's website, found at foundmyfitness.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

### Compliance
Sauna use may offer a unique advantage in terms of compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. For sedentary individuals with cardiovascular disease risk factors, it can be very difficult to get them to be physically active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. However, since people often perceive saunas as a spa treatment, they are more willing to try it, unknowingly mimicking moderate aerobic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

## Additive Effects with Other Longevity Strategies

While there's no specific data proving an additive effect of combining sauna with all other longevity strategies, it is believed that there is cross-talk between the pathways they affect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

*   **Exercise and Sauna**: There is a proven [[benefits_of_sauna_combined_with_exercise | additive effect]] between physical activity and sauna use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. Improvements in mitochondrial function in muscle tissue are enhanced when physically active individuals use the sauna, compared to sedentary individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.
*   **Fasting and Time-Restricted Eating (TRE)**: Fasting can also activate heat shock proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. TRE, which involves eating all food within a specific window (e.g., 6-11 hours), offers benefits such as activating stress response pathways that clear cellular debris and dysfunctional organelles (like mitochondria), and promoting rejuvenation through the replacement of old cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Eating food when one is most insulin sensitive (typically in the morning) is another benefit of TRE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
*   **Prolonged Fasting**: Longer fasts (at least 48 hours) can lead to organ shrinkage during the fasting phase, where preferentially damaged old cells die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. The refeeding phase then causes stem cells to proliferate, replacing lost cells with healthy, new young cells, leading to an "amazing rejuvenation process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. This has shown promise in autoimmune diseases and potentially in sensitizing cancer cells to treatment while protecting normal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
*   **Broccoli Sprouts**: Broccoli sprouts are also mentioned as another important tool for improving healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.
