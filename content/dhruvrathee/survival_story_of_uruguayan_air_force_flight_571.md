On October 12, 1972, a small chartered aircraft departed from Uruguay, South America, heading towards Santiago, the capital of Chile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The plane was carrying 45 passengers, including rugby players and some of their family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The flight was expected to last only three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. However, the route required crossing the immense [[Andes Mountains Plane Crash | Andes Mountains]], the world's longest mountain range, which can be particularly devastating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Journey and the Crash
On the day of departure, a storm in the mountains prevented the plane from continuing its flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Pilots decided to make an overnight stop in Mendoza, Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The next day, October 13, the plane took off again at 2:18 p.m., with pilots ensuring clear weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The flight was smooth for the first hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

At 3:21 p.m., as the plane began its descent near Santiago, it encountered severe turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Clouds enveloped the aircraft, making visibility impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Alarms blared, and warning lights flashed, but the rugby players, initially unfazed by the turbulence, joked around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. As the clouds cleared, a passenger saw the plane was perilously close to a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Upon realizing the danger, the pilots immediately tried to lift the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Despite putting in maximum power, it was too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The rear of the aircraft collided with the mountain, separating entirely, and two rows of seats flew out, carrying three passengers with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The plane then plummeted, losing its left wing in a second collision, causing more passengers to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The front portion of the plane crashed into a glacier, sliding 700 meters at 350 km/h before coming to a destructive halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The cockpit was crushed, killing the pilots immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The aircraft lay broken on an unknown mountain in the Andes at an altitude of 3,570 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Remarkably, 33 of the 45 people on board survived the initial crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. It was later determined that the plane was 80 km off its planned route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath and Initial Survival
Among the survivors were 19-year-old Roberto Canessa and 20-year-old Gustavo Zerbino, both medical students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. They immediately began tending to the injured, many of whom had severe wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Fernando Parrado, 23, was in a coma due to a skull fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Search Efforts and Growing Despair
Within an hour of the plane's disappearance, the Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service was notified and deployed four aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Despite searching from dusk till night, they found nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Officials concluded the aircraft must have crashed in a remote, inaccessible area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The plane's white color made it incredibly difficult to spot against the snow and ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

On the night of October 13, survivors clung to hope, believing they would be found the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, five injured passengers succumbed to the snowy conditions that night, reducing the number of survivors from 33 to 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. They used the plane's fuselage as shelter, sealing the rear with luggage, seats, and snow to retain warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

On October 14, eleven aircraft from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay joined the [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search operation]] within the correct search area, yet failed to locate the crash site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Survivors tried writing "SOS" on the plane's roof with lipstick but lacked enough to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. They then attempted to form a large cross in the snow with suitcases, but this also proved ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Three aircraft flew over them that day, but their screams and waves went unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

By October 15, the need for water became critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. A passenger named Fito Strauch devised a method to melt snow using a metal sheet as a solar collector, collecting water droplets in empty wine bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Seat cushions were used as snowshoes, and wool from seat covers provided insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

On October 16, three days after the crash, Fernando Parrado awoke from his coma, discovering his mother had died and his 19-year-old sister was severely injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Despite his best efforts, his sister succumbed to her injuries eight days after the crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

> This accident serves as a stark reminder of life's unpredictable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The video transitions to a self-promotion for a "Time Management course," highlighting the importance of living every moment, as tomorrow is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The course aims to double productivity and happiness, offering practical techniques used by the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. A 40% discount was offered for the first 400 people using the code LOST40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The course is in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Most passengers, from coastal areas, had never seen snow before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. They were now enduring -30° Celsius temperatures at high altitude with inadequate food and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Another challenge was snow blindness, caused by the sun's ultraviolet rays reflecting off the snow and ice, damaging their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. They had only three pairs of sunglasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

On October 21, eight days after the crash, [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search and rescue teams]] officially ceased operations, concluding there was little chance of finding survivors after so much time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. After 142 hours of searching, the operation was stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Meanwhile, survivors found a transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Roy Harley, a rugby player with electronics knowledge, improvised a long antenna, and the radio began working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Eleven days after the crash, they heard the devastating news that the search operation had been canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Hearts broken, some cried, while Fernando Parrado remained calm, already contemplating another plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Desperate Measures: Cannibalism
By the 11th day, food supplies were nearly exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. They had only meager rations: 8 chocolate bars, 1 tin of mussels, 3 small jars of jam, a jar of almonds, a box of peanuts, some dates, candies, dried plums, and a few bottles of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. They had rationed food, with Parrado eating just one chocolate-covered peanut over three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

At 3,800 meters, there were no trees, plants, or animals to hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. With food gone, some tried eating cotton and leather from seats, which only made them sicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Facing starvation, the survivors made a shocking decision: to eat the bodies of their deceased friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Roberto Canessa, who proposed the idea, was the first to try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Others initially refused but, two days later, with no other option, they too resorted to eating human meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Further Disasters: The Avalanche
On October 29, 16 days after the crash, their new food source was also depleting, and they had no plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. That night, a loud grumble heralded an avalanche that buried the broken plane, suffocating eight people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Only 19 survivors remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Trapped in a small space under the snow, Parrado used a metal pole to create a ventilation hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. After two days of arduous digging, they created a tunnel and reached the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. A snowstorm forced them back into their snow cave for three more days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

When the weather cleared, survivors realized no one was coming to save them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. They decided to make their own efforts to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Canessa, Parrado, and Vizintin, the strongest among them, were chosen to embark on an expedition for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. They were given more food and the warmest clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## The Expedition for Help
Their initial task was to estimate their location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Before the crash, the co-pilot had stated they passed Curico, leading them to believe walking a few kilometers west would lead them to Chilean countryside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This estimation was gravely wrong; the crash site was 89 km east, deep in the Andes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

After a few days of rest, on November 15, 33 days after the crash, the three set out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Traveling east, they found the plane's separated tail section, containing suitcases, chocolates, meat patties, rum, clothes, comic books, medicines, and crucially, the aircraft's two-way radio system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. They decided to try to activate the radio for an SOS call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. They found 24 kg batteries in the tail section, but they were too heavy to carry back to the main fuselage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. With the help of Roy Harley, they attempted to start the radio there, but the aircraft's 115V AC system was incompatible with the 24V DC battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. After several failed attempts, they realized their only option was to walk westward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

On December 11, 59 days after the crash, another avalanche struck, killing three more survivors, leaving only 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. To survive the -30° Celsius nights during their climb, 18-year-old Carlos Miguel Rodriguez, who remembered his mother's sewing lessons, stitched together pieces of clothing to make a large sleeping bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

On December 12, two months after the crash, Parrado, Canessa, and Vizintin began climbing the glacier without mountaineering gear, maps, compasses, or climbing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. They still believed Chile was just a few kilometers west, expecting to find help in 2-3 days, and packed a 3-day supply of meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Parrado wore multiple layers of clothing, including three pairs of jeans and four pairs of socks covered by plastic bags, to combat the extreme cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The thin air at high altitude also made breathing difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

The improvised sleeping bag proved vital at night, allowing them to huddle together for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. After three days of climbing, on the morning of the fourth day, they realized their initial estimation was terribly wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. With dwindling food, Vizintin decided to return to the crash site to conserve resources, sliding back on an aircraft seat in just an hour—a journey that took them three days to ascend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

Parrado and Canessa continued climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Three hours later, they reached the mountain peak, only to see endless snowy mountains in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Desperate, Parrado spotted two snow-free mountain peaks on the far western horizon and decided they must travel in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

They hiked for many more days, eventually reaching a valley with a flowing river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Following the river downstream, they continued their arduous trek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. After nine days of walking, on December 20, they finally saw signs of human presence: cows in fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Too exhausted to walk further, they then saw three men on horseback across the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. Parrado shouted, but the river's noise drowned him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. By chance, one man spotted them and shouted, "Tomorrow!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

## The Rescue
The next day, the man, a Chilean farmer named Sergio Catalan, returned with paper and pencils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. He tied them to a stone and threw them across the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. For the first time, Parrado could send a message to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. He wrote in Spanish that he was from a plane that crashed in the mountains, had walked for 10 days, and that his injured friends were at the crash site, in urgent need of help and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

Sergio Catalan recognized the vague news of a plane crash months ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Shocked to find survivors of a two-month-old crash, he threw them a piece of bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. For the next 10 hours, he rode west on horseback to the nearest city to inform the army command in Santiago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

Farmers brought Parrado and Canessa to Los Maitenes, where they finally rested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. It was discovered they had hiked 61 km on foot over the last 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Canessa had lost half his body weight, weighing only 44 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Their story quickly became international news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

The Chilean Air Force immediately dispatched three helicopters for rescue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Army officers interviewed Parrado, who had kept the pilot's flight chart and plotted their hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. With Parrado's guidance in a helicopter, the crash site and the remaining survivors were located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.

On December 22, 1972, 70 days after the crash, two search and rescue helicopters finally reached the survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

## The Miracle of the Andes
In total, 16 survivors were rescued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. They were suffering from altitude sickness, dehydration, broken bones, and malnutrition but eventually recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. This [[andes_mountains_plane_crash | survival story]], often referred to as the [[the_miracle_of_the_andes | Miracle of the Andes]], stands as a testament to hope, patience, and the indomitable human spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.
