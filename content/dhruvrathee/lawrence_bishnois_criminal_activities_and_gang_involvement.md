Lawrence Bishnoi is a prominent Indian gangster with a significant criminal record, contrasting sharply with the public perception of the [[comparison_between_anil_bishnoi_and_lawrence_bishnoi | Bishnoi community's]] wildlife protection efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Despite some social media users mistakenly praising him as "India's new Bhagat Singh," Lawrence Bishnoi has 84 cases registered against him and no known involvement in [[wildlife_protection_efforts_by_anil_bishnoi | wildlife protection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Entry into Criminality via Student Politics

Lawrence Bishnoi studied at a college in Chandigarh and became involved in [[role_of_student_politics_in_the_rise_of_gangsters | student politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. His criminal activities began during his student political campaigns:
*   During a student election campaign, a fight broke out with an opposing party, and one of his friends fired a warning shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   Five days later, he and his friends allegedly set fire to a rival candidate's car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. He was arrested with eight friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   While in jail, he met a weapons supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   After his release, criminal activities continued, leading to more cases, which were later quashed due to compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   In 2010, he ran for Student Organisation President of Punjab University and, after losing, allegedly attacked his rival candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   He won the election in 2011 after being released on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   By the time he was in college, he faced about 18 charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   After obtaining a law degree in 2012, he continued his criminal path, appearing in court as an accused, not a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   In 2013, he allegedly conspired in the murder of a rival nominee during a campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   He was caught at a police picket in 2014 and escaped police custody in 2015 before being re-arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Gang Leadership and Alliances

By 2015, Lawrence Bishnoi had established himself as a gang leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. His friend, Goldy Brar, took over running the gang while Bishnoi was in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Lawrence-Kala Jathedi Syndicate
Lawrence Bishnoi joined forces with Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This alliance, despite later internal conflict, was responsible for 30 murders across Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Other gangs in their syndicate included Sube Gujjar and Anandpal Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Criminal Activities and Rivalries

The primary reason for gang rivalries, particularly between Lawrence Bishnoi's gang and Davinder Bambiha's gang, was extortion money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Gangs would threaten individuals for money, promising protection from other gangs if paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Davinder Bambiha's extortion racket operated in Chandigarh, Mohali, and Panchkula, an area Lawrence desired control over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. These inter-gang rivalries led to shootouts in Punjab, Delhi, and Chandigarh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Another reason for conflict was control over the Punjab music industry and Kabaddi players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## The Reality of Gangster Life

The life of a gangster, despite glorification in movies, is far from desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Gangsters live in constant fear of being killed by rivals or in police encounters, or being imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. They lack the freedom of ordinary people to enjoy simple pleasures like visiting public places or celebrating with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Many end up dead, in jail, or suffer from depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. Their criminal choices also severely impact their families, with relatives often ending up in jail or disowning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
