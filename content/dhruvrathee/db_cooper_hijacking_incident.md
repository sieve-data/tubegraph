On November 24, 1971, a Northwest Orient Airlines flight took off from Portland, America, bound for Seattle, a short 30-minute journey away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The flight carried 36 passengers and 6 crew members, unaware that a hijacker was among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Hijacker: Dan Cooper

The hijacker, known as Dan Cooper (later misidentified as D.B. Cooper), appeared to be a normal businessman in his mid-forties, dressed in a business suit, white shirt, and black pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He intentionally chose seat 18E in the last row of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Shortly after takeoff, Cooper introduced himself to 23-year-old air hostess Florence Schaffner, handing her a note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Schaffner, initially thinking he was flirting, put the note away without reading it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Cooper then told her to read it, stating he had a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The note clearly stated, "Miss, I have a b0mb in my briefcase and I want you to sit by me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Schaffner quietly sat next to him, still skeptical until Cooper opened his briefcase to reveal red cylinders, wires, and a large cylindrical battery, confirming it was a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Cooper's Demands

Cooper made specific demands:
*   $200,000 in cash by 5 pm that evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Four parachutes (two front, two back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   A fuel truck ready to refuel the plane upon landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

He threatened to blow up the plane if his demands were not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The other passengers remained unaware of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Schaffner discreetly informed the pilots in the cockpit by showing them Cooper's note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Another air hostess, Tina Mucklow, was informed and sat beside Cooper to maintain communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

The pilots notified air traffic control, and the news reached Donald Nairob, the president of Northwest Orient Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Nairob made the decision to comply fully with Cooper's demands to protect the airline's reputation and avoid widespread panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. After coordinating with the [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]], a Seattle bank arranged the money from a special emergency bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Since the flight was only 30 minutes, the pilots were instructed to circle Seattle for three hours until the money could be arranged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Passengers were told there were minor technical difficulties causing the delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Landing and Second Leg

The flight finally landed at Seattle's airport at 5:46 pm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The plane was parked away from the main terminal, and an airline representative delivered the money and four parachutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Cooper then allowed all passengers and flight attendants, except Tina Mucklow, to leave the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The plane was refueled and took off again with only the pilots, Cooper, and Tina on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Cooper began giving precise instructions for the flight's destination, speed, and angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. He directed them to fly towards Mexico City at an altitude of 10,000 feet, with wings at 15°, and as slow as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The pilots noted insufficient fuel for Mexico City at those configurations, but Cooper was unconcerned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## The Jump

Cooper instructed Tina to go to the cockpit and lock the door, leaving him as the only person outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. He prepared his parachutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Minutes later, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating the rear staircase had been deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This unique feature of Boeing 727 planes allowed an aft staircase at the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Cooper deployed these stairs and jumped out with the parachutes and the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The pilots and air hostess, locked in the cockpit, did not witness the jump directly, as there was no peephole in the cockpit door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. At 8:13 pm, the pilots noticed the plane's back end suddenly tilt upwards, requiring them to recalibrate and re-level the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The plane then flew to Reno, Nevada, and landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Initial [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | Investigation]]

Upon landing, police investigated the plane but found no trace of Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The only items recovered were a tie with a clip, torn pieces of parachutes Cooper used to cover the money bag, and personal items like his cigarettes (smoking was allowed on planes then) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Investigators found 66 unidentified fingerprints belonging to neither crew nor passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The bomb suitcase, money bag, and parachutes were all missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

The [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] began its search for Cooper, which continued for 45 years before officially closing in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This remains the only unsolved hijack in history and one of the greatest [[the_mystery_and_unresolved_questions_about_db_cooper | mysteries]] for the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Key Aspects and Public Perception

Two significant aspects of the incident stand out:
1.  **Passenger Unawareness and Safety:** No other passenger knew about the hijack, and no one was killed or injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Tina Mucklow is often hailed as a hero for keeping Cooper calm, ensuring his demands were met, and preventing panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Co-pilot Rataczak praised her calm demeanor under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
2.  **The Name "DB Cooper":** The hijacker's actual name was Dan Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The "DB" prefix originated from a mistake by news reporter James Long, who misheard "Dan Cooper" as "DB Cooper" while rushing to meet a deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This error was picked up by other journalists and widely used, cementing "DB Cooper" as the popular name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This phenomenon is known in psychology as Anchoring, a cognitive bias where humans rely too heavily on the first piece of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Brandolini's Law (Bullshit Asymmetry Principle) suggests it's difficult to correct such initial misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## The Search for Cooper's Fate

Initial [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI investigations]] posited that Cooper strapped about 10 kilos of cash around himself and used two parachutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. He was estimated to have jumped in the southwest area of Washington State, characterized by pine forests, lakes, and canyons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Investigators initially believed Cooper could not have survived due to:
*   Jumping from 10,000 feet in pitch darkness at 8 pm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   Wearing clothes unsuitable for jumping (pants and shirt) in the rain and heavy clouds at 5,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   High wind speed, estimated at 320 km/h at the time of jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   The risk of hypothermia if landing in cold water, exacerbated by the weight of the cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### The [[impact_of_db_cooper_on_aviation_and_hijacking_methods | Impact of DB Cooper on Aviation and Hijacking Methods]]

However, subsequent incidents forced a reconsideration of Cooper's survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. After Cooper's widely publicized hijacking, at least five copycat hijackings occurred using similar tactics, and all five hijackers survived their jumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Martin McNally (June 24, 1972):** Hijacked a plane, demanded $500,000, and jumped with a parachute at 400-500 km/h (twice Cooper's estimated speed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. McNally survived using only a reserve parachute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Richard Lapoint (January 1972):** Wore similar clothes and landed safely in the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Although these hijackers were later caught, the [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] concluded that if these individuals could survive worse conditions, then DB Cooper might have survived too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This was further supported by Cooper's statement to Tina Mucklow that he knew how to use parachutes without instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## The Money and Its Discovery

The special nature of the money given to Cooper was that it consisted of 10,000 $20 bills, totaling $200,000, and all serial numbers were noted by the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. The [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] disseminated this list to banks and casinos nationwide, offering $1,000 for any discovered note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. For three years, not a single note was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

In 1979, eight years after the hijack, pilot Tom Bohan of Continental Airlines contacted the [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Bohan, who was flying another aircraft 4 minutes behind and 4,000 feet above Cooper's plane that night, recalled an unprecedented storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. He asserted that the [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]]'s drop zone calculations were off by 80° and suggested searching near the drainage area of the Washougal River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

A few months later, his suspicion was confirmed when an 8-year-old boy found $3,000 worth of $20 notes on the bank of the Columbia River, some still in bundles with rubber bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. The serial numbers matched the money given to Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Although only $5,800 was recovered in total from the area, Tom's hypothesis about the landing zone was proven correct, as the money was found downstream from the Washougal River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] agent Richard Tosaw believed Cooper must have drowned in the cold river water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

The 8-year-old boy who found the notes was rewarded with a portion of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. In 2008, he sold 15 of these $20 notes at an online auction for $37,000, demonstrating the enduring popularity of the Cooper case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## [[theories_and_suspects_in_the_db_cooper_case | Theories and Suspects in the DB Cooper Case]]

The [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] had limited clues to Cooper's identity: the tie and tie clip he left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. In March 2009, a research team, including a palaeontologist, scientific illustrator, and metallurgist, used new technology like electron microscopy to examine microscopic particles on the golden tie clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. They found portions of unalloyed titanium with traces of aluminum and titanium antimony alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. These findings suggested Cooper worked in a chemical or metal manufacturing plant, or an aeronautical engineering company, possibly Boeing itself, as unalloyed titanium was used in aircraft fabrication facilities then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### Suspect Sketches

Early in the [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | investigation]], the [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] created sketches of Cooper based on passenger and crew descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   The first sketch (November 28, 1971) was deemed inaccurate by witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   A second sketch a year later was also inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   The third and final sketch (January 2, 1973) was considered accurate by an air hostess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

Based on these descriptions, particularly the knowledge of aircraft and parachutes, Larry Carr, who led the investigative team from 2006-2009, believed Cooper was an aircraft cargo loader in the Air Force, as they received basic jump training and understood plane mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. The [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] compiled a list of over 800 suspects, with 20 considered seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

### Prominent Suspects

*   **Richard McCoy:** A Vietnam War veteran, McCoy hijacked a Boeing 727 five months after Cooper, using similar methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. He demanded $500,000 and four parachutes, then jumped from the rear stairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. The [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] caught and arrested him two days later, sentencing him to 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. The [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] initially believed he was Cooper, making a second attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The book "DB Cooper, The Real McCoy" (1991) by former [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] agent Russell Caleme supported this, and McCoy's family identified Cooper's tie and clip as his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. McCoy himself refused to confirm or deny being Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. He was killed during a jailbreak attempt two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Today, the [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] does not officially consider McCoy as DB Cooper because his description did not match the sketch, and evidence placed him in Las Vegas on the night of Cooper's hijacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

*   **Robert Rackstraw:** Another Vietnam War veteran, Rackstraw had a history of arrests for fraud, aircraft theft, and explosives possession, though he was often acquitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. TV producer Thomas Colbert's 2016 book "The Last Master Outlaw" and History Channel documentary "DB Cooper: Case Closed" argued that Rackstraw was DB Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Colbert and his team, including former [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] agents, believed Rackstraw was the real Cooper, noting he was an early suspect in the 1970s and his face matched the sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. The [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] removed him from the suspect list after 1979 due to insufficient evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Coincidentally, the [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | FBI]] closed the case the day after Colbert launched his book in July 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Rackstraw lost his job due to the allegations and passed away from natural causes in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Enduring [[the_mystery_and_unresolved_questions_about_db_cooper | Mystery]]

The DB Cooper hijacking remains an unsolved [[the_mystery_and_unresolved_questions_about_db_cooper | mystery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. No one definitively knows who DB Cooper was, where he came from, or where he went <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. Despite many similar hijackings occurring afterward where culprits were caught and survived their jumps, Cooper uniquely evaded capture and disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
