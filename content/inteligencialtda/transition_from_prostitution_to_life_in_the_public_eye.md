Raquel Pacheco, famously known as Bruna Surfistinha, discusses her journey from a rebellious teenager to a public figure, detailing her experiences in prostitution, her unexpected rise to fame through blogging, and her subsequent life changes, including marriage, motherhood, and advocacy.

### Early Life and Familial Challenges

Born on October 28th, Raquel Pacheco described herself as a very lonely and shy child growing up in Sorocaba [01:17:28]. She was adopted, discovering this fact between the ages of four and five [02:52:54]. She believes this early revelation caused significant mental confusion and contributed to a persistent feeling of not belonging and being "strange" [02:53:11]. Her adoptive mother's insensitive revelation and the subsequent feeling of rejection have impacted her to this day, requiring continuous self-work [03:19:01]. Raquel notes that her adoptive parents were older, and there was a large generational gap [01:17:45].

Her parents, both highly educated (her father was a prosecutor, and her sisters followed legal careers), encouraged her to pursue law [02:16:32]. However, Raquel was never interested in the legal field, particularly disliking the graphic crime scene photos she sometimes saw in her father's cases [02:24:45].

As a teenager, Raquel became rebellious around age 13, embracing forbidden behaviors like smoking and skipping class to gain her parents' attention, which they had previously withheld when she was a good student [02:30:57]. This period led to depression, for which she sought therapy [02:44:03]. She developed a strong bond with her psychologist, who became her best and only true friend, unlike her parents with whom communication was "horrible" due to their closed-mindedness and lack of patience [02:51:20]. This experience inspired her lifelong desire to become a psychologist herself [02:59:30].

The rebellion escalated when her father cut off her allowance and privileges after discovering she used the money for vices [03:17:40]. Desperate, she resorted to stealing money and even a valuable jewelry set from her parents, leading to intense confrontations and physical abuse from her father [03:22:20]. Following the theft, her parents began treating her as a "stranger" or "bandit," locking their rooms and hiding keys, restricting her access within the house [03:53:03]. Her father also arranged a visit to a minors' forum (Febem) as a scare tactic, hoping it would deter her from further misbehavior [03:59:08]. While the experience instilled a lasting lesson against stealing, it ultimately severed her relationship with her parents, leading to a profound sense of alienation within her own home [04:59:58].

### Entry into Prostitution

At 17, Raquel felt the situation at home was unbearable, leading her to contemplate suicide [04:09:47]. However, during a moment of reflection, she decided to choose life and pursue her dreams of becoming a mother and having a family [04:06:34].

Without money or support, she decided to run away from home [04:16:15]. She searched newspaper ads for job opportunities and noticed calls for prostitution [04:28:28]. These ads promised women aged 18-25 could earn up to 1,000 reais per week serving executives [04:37:04]. She first visited a nightclub in Santana, which she found to have a "strange smell" and "heavy energy," and realized her shyness would hinder her ability to seduce clients and encourage drink sales [04:57:07]. Next, she tried a massage clinic, initially thinking it was just about massages, but soon realized the sexual nature of the work [05:07:37].

Finally, she visited a private house on Alameda Franca, Jardins, which appealed to her desire for an intense sexual discovery phase [05:18:18]. A week before her 18th birthday, she packed a small backpack with minimal belongings, including her ID (fearing being buried unnamed if something happened) [05:40:07], and left a farewell letter for her parents, making it clear she was moving on with her life [05:43:08]. She left without money, having spent her last funds on cigarettes [05:51:09].

### Life as a Call Girl: Bruna Surfistinha is Born

Upon arriving at the private house, Raquel, still 17, lied about her age, claiming to be 18 [06:12:12]. The manager, who knew her true age, warned her about the dangers of being underage [06:15:00]. Without suitable work clothes or makeup, a colleague named Gabi lent her some attire and essential items like lubricant [06:20:42]. Raquel was completely inexperienced in both sex and prostitution [06:19:02]. Gabi, her first friend in the house, also gave her the professional name "Bruna" [06:22:00], which helped Raquel separate her real identity from her work persona [06:22:52].

Raquel's first client quickly realized her inexperience but was kind, acting like a "psychologist" for her [07:29:02]. He advised her that she was too shy for the profession and could find a "smarter way" to make money [07:33:02]. This client, a married man with a daughter, embodied a common sentiment among male clients: the ability to separate sex from love [07:49:09].

Working as a call girl involved demanding routines and challenging [[challenges_and_experiences_in_prostitution | experiences]]. Clients often sought paid sex as a straightforward transaction, preferring it over girlfriends or lovers to avoid emotional bonds [08:03:00]. Prostitution, for Raquel, offered a "transparent" human relationship where no one deceived anyone [08:52:55]. She saw it as an opportunity for personal growth and observation, useful for her eventual goal of becoming a psychologist [09:07:07].

Raquel also encountered unique situations, including clients with unusual fetishes. One client, driven by cocaine-induced neurosis, panicked and hid under the bed, thinking the police were after him, requiring Raquel and the manager to physically lift the bed to get him out [03:09:59]. Another fetish involved a client who wanted to watch Raquel and other girls model "grandmother lingerie" while he masturbated, finding satisfaction in watching the display rather than engaging in sexual acts [03:22:50]. She also experienced requests from clients who wanted to smell another man's scent on her or taste it from her mouth, a fetish known as cuckolding [04:05:07].

### The Blog and Public Emergence

In 2004, while working in prostitution, Raquel began creating and [[creating_and_maintaining_a_blog_as_a_call_girl | maintaining a blog]]. She had always loved writing in diaries [04:42:07]. When slow periods at work left her bored, she used a notebook to document her daily experiences, emotions, and client interactions, initially without any intention of publishing [04:46:17].

Curious if other call girls had blogs, she searched online but found none [04:59:02]. This gave her the idea to create her own, titling it "The Day-to-Day of a Call Girl" [05:06:06]. Her first post was a long, revealing text about her childhood and why she entered prostitution [05:09:47]. Fearing overexposure, she considered deleting it, but her intuition urged her to proceed [05:14:00]. A friend, Gabi, discouraged her, questioning who would read a call girl's blog [05:19:01]. Despite this, Raquel decided to publish shorter, more basic texts [05:24:07].

The blog gained rapid popularity through word-of-mouth, especially on an online forum (GPGuia) where clients discussed call girls [06:09:02]. Clients who liked her services praised her online, leading to increased demand [06:10:07]. Raquel used this as a marketing strategy, inviting clients to comment on her blog [06:17:01].

Her anonymity was short-lived. In August 2004, journalist Pedro Dória, researching call girls using the internet, contacted her for an interview after finding her blog [07:30:52]. The interview, along with her non-identifying photo and phone number, was published early the next day [07:49:50]. This caused her phone to ring non-stop, attracting the attention of major media outlets like Super Pop and Veja magazine [07:55:00]. Overnight, Raquel Pacheco became "Bruna Surfistinha" to the media, a sudden public exposure she wasn't prepared for [08:08:44].

The public eye brought both love and hate. While many fans supported her, she also faced harsh criticism and negative comments online, which were difficult to cope with at 19 years old [08:24:07]. She learned to ignore hateful remarks and focus only on positive feedback [08:28:53]. Soon after, she appeared on national television, including Luciana Gimenez's show, initially with a mask, but eventually decided to show her face [08:53:57]. The media attention significantly boosted her bookings, making her schedule extremely busy [09:06:05].

### Personal Transformation and New Beginnings

By 2005, Raquel had made the conscious decision that it would be her last year in prostitution [10:18:07]. She focused intensely on saving money, abstaining from drugs after a near-overdose experience in 2004, which she viewed as a second chance at life [10:55:00]. This traumatic event, depicted differently in the movie, was a spiritual moment where she promised a figure in white she would never use drugs again [11:15:05]. To further her goal, she moved out of the private house and began serving clients in her own apartment to save on costs [12:51:00]. This decision, however, caused her significant neuroticism, as she meticulously cleaned to leave no trace for her live-in partner, João [13:02:00].

In January 2005, she met João, who was initially a client [13:06:09]. Their relationship evolved from professional to friendship, marked by deep conversations rather than sex [14:59:00]. Raquel eventually felt uncomfortable receiving his money and gave him an ultimatum: choose to be friends with "Raquel" outside the professional context or continue as a client of "Bruna" [15:53:00]. João chose to be friends with Raquel, and they fell in love, marrying in June 2005 and remaining together for 10 years [16:00:00].

This personal relationship impacted her work in prostitution, as she found it emotionally challenging to separate sex from love [16:40:00]. Her income decreased as she adjusted her schedule to align with João's work, and she ultimately decided to retire from prostitution in October 2005, celebrating her 21st birthday as a new beginning [17:25:00].

### Authorship and Media Legacy

Her blog's success led to a book deal. Marcelo Duarte, the owner of a publishing house, noticed her blog and, after reading her desire to write a book, contacted her in 2005 [18:00:00]. As Raquel was focused on her retirement from prostitution, Duarte suggested a ghostwriter to transcribe her conversations and incorporate her existing blog texts [18:08:00]. The book, "O Doce Veneno do Escorpião" (The Sweet Poison of the Scorpion), became a Brazilian bestseller and was translated into multiple languages [19:00:00].

The book's success quickly attracted attention from TV Zero, a production company, leading to a film adaptation. Raquel found it hard to imagine her "ordinary" life as a movie but recognized the value in her unique story [20:47:00]. Deborah Secco was cast as Bruna Surfistinha after an extensive casting process [21:28:00]. Raquel admired Secco and met with her and acting coach Sérgio Penna, noting their strong connection and detailed conversations about her life [21:36:00]. The film, released in February 2011, took five years to produce due to challenges in securing sponsorship from brands reluctant to associate with the image of prostitution, which Raquel viewed as hypocrisy [23:19:00].

Years later, a series titled "Call Me Bruna" was also created, which Raquel found to be more detailed and different from the movie, addressing important topics like prejudice against the trans community [24:41:00].

### Life Beyond Bruna Surfistinha

Despite her impactful past, Raquel wants people to see beyond the three years she spent in prostitution [25:07:00]. Now, at almost 38, she is a mother to twin daughters, Elis and Maria, a role she always dreamed of [26:17:00]. Motherhood has been a transformative experience, making her re-evaluate her own childhood and commit to raising her children with love rather than through pain, a lesson she learned from her own upbringing [27:35:00]. She actively works on her healing from the rejection she experienced as an adopted child [28:30:00].

Raquel admits that being a mother of twins without a strong support network is "very difficult," especially during this stage where her daughters require constant attention while learning to walk and talk [29:26:00]. She cherishes each day's evolution and recognizes the rapid growth of children, regretting not fully enjoying her own 20s due to her marriage [30:52:00].

While she has no contact with her adoptive family, she respects their boundaries. She sees her past relationship with them as a "circle that needed to close," believing they each had lessons to learn [31:11:00]. She emphasizes that her adoptive mother's actions, like abandoning her as a teenager, demonstrated a lack of true motherhood [31:18:00]. She maintains contact with Gabi, her first friend from the prostitution house, but generally finds it difficult to maintain friendships with former call girls due to the transient nature of the profession [32:00:00].

Raquel's journey is a testament to [[overcoming_personal_challenges_and_transformation | overcoming personal challenges and transformation]]. She continues to advocate for acceptance and openly shares her story, now focusing on her new family and ongoing projects. Her message is one of resilience, self-love, and the power of intuition [33:31:00].
