The concept of time has intrigued humanity throughout history. Early civilizations defined time based on observed cycles like day and night, or the phases of the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This human-centric definition helped establish routines for daily life, including agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:01">[02:20:01]</a>. However, from a physical perspective, time remains an unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

## Time as a Human Concept
Ancient methods of tracking time relied on astronomical observations. Early humans marked the moon's passage, recognizing its changing phases as a clearer indicator than the sun's consistent appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. Evidence of this includes a 30,000-year-old monkey bone marked with lunar phases, found at the Natural History Museum in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. Constellations were also vital, used by Egyptians to predict planting and harvesting seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

The modern definition of a second is based on the decay time of the Cesium-133 atom, specifically 9 billion vibrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, although it is now being updated to the time light takes to travel a certain distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. The division of a day into 24 hours and minutes into 60 stems from the use of sundials, where circles were divided into equal intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

## Time in Physics
### Minkowski and Space-Time
The idea of a [[cosmological_theories_and_the_concept_of_cosmic_void | four-dimensional universe]], where time is the fourth dimension, was introduced by Hermann Minkowski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. This concept describes our reality as "space-time," a single entity where we move in three spatial dimensions and one unique temporal direction: forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:08">[03:03:08]</a>. We are constantly [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | traveling through time]] at a rate of one second per second towards the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Entropy and the Arrow of Time
Within physics, especially thermodynamics, time is defined by entropy, which refers to the measure of disorder in a system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy always increases in an isolated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>. This increase in disorder defines the "arrow of time," meaning that most physical processes in the universe are irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. For example, a broken glass cannot spontaneously reassemble, nor can a cooked omelet return to its raw egg form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>. This principle is a major barrier to [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | time travel to the past]] in our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>.

### Theories of Relativity
Albert Einstein's theories of relativity fundamentally changed the understanding of time.

#### Special Relativity and Speed-Based Time Dilation
Special Relativity posits that time is not homogeneous; it passes differently depending on the observer's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. As an object approaches the [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | speed of light]], time passes slower for that object relative to a stationary observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>. This phenomenon, known as time dilation, has been experimentally confirmed in particle accelerators like the LHC, where accelerated particles exhibit longer decay times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

This concept is crucial for [[interstellar_travel_and_reference_frames | interstellar travel and reference frames]]. For instance, if a spaceship were to travel at 90% the speed of light to Alpha Centauri (4.2 light-years away), the journey would take 4.2 years for observers on Earth. However, for the astronauts inside the ship, only about two months would pass, due to time dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. This highlights the relativistic nature of time, where its passage depends on the observer's frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

#### General Relativity and Gravity-Based Time Dilation
General Relativity extends this idea, stating that gravity also influences the passage of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. The stronger the gravitational field, the slower time passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>. This effect is subtle but critical; for example, GPS satellites must account for both speed and gravitational time dilation to provide accurate positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

The film *Interstellar* famously illustrates this concept. On Miller's Planet, which orbits very close to a supermassive [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_time | black hole]], time passes much slower than on the distant mothership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>. Two hours on Miller's Planet equated to 27 years on the mothership, effectively allowing the characters to "[[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | travel to the future]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:11">[01:32:11]</a>.

### Newtonian Physics vs. Relativity
Newtonian physics, while sufficient for everyday terrestrial phenomena, does not account for the extreme conditions of high speeds or strong gravitational fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. Relativity, however, encompasses Newtonian mechanics; at low speeds and weak gravitational fields, Einstein's equations simplify to Newton's laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

### Black Holes and Time
[[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_time | Black holes]] are extreme examples of space-time distortion. Their immense gravity causes time to slow down significantly nearby, and theoretically, stop at the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. An observer falling into a black hole would experience time normally, but a distant observer would see their time passage slow to a halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a>.

### Wormholes and Theoretical Travel
[[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_time | Wormholes]] are theoretical passages through space-time that could connect distant points, potentially allowing for faster-than-light travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:21">[02:09:21]</a>. While predicted by general relativity, they have not been observed and would likely require "exotic matter" with negative mass or energy density to remain stable and traversable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>. Wormholes could shorten paths through space, but current understanding suggests they would not allow travel to past points in one's own timeline, preserving the second law of thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:11">[02:14:11]</a>.

### Quantum Entanglement and Non-Causality
Quantum physics introduces phenomena like quantum entanglement, where two particles become linked regardless of distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. An observation of one particle instantly affects the other, even if separated by thousands of light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. This "non-causal" behavior, where information appears to travel faster than light, troubled Einstein but has been experimentally proven, earning a Nobel Prize in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. This area suggests limitations of relativity at quantum scales, indicating that the laws of physics operate differently in the "Ant-Man universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

### Theoretical Predictions vs. Experimental Proof
In physics, there is a distinction between theoretical predictions and experimental verification. [[black_holes_and_theoretical_physics | Black holes]], for example, were first predicted by mathematical calculations from Einstein's equations before being observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:7:12">[02:7:12]</a>. Many [[scientific_and_philosophical_theories_about_alien_life | theories]], like those involving tachyons (hypothetical particles faster than light) or wormholes, exist on paper but lack experimental proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. A scientific theory must be refutable; otherwise, it becomes dogma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:26">[03:09:26]</a>.

## Paradoxes of Time Travel
### Grandfather Paradox
The grandfather paradox asks: if one travels to the past and kills their own grandfather before their parents are born, how can they exist in the future to make the trip? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:23">[01:47:23]</a> This paradox serves as an argument against the possibility of past [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | time travel]].

### Bootstrap Paradox
The Bootstrap Paradox, also known as the ontological paradox, describes a situation where an item or information is sent back in time, and then becomes its own origin. For example, if someone travels to the past to give Guimarães Rosa his own published book, who truly wrote the book? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> This paradox suggests that if something lacks an original source, time travel to the past may be impossible or must adhere to a principle of self-consistency, where events unfold exactly as they already did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>.

### Twin Paradox
The twin paradox, while often presented as a paradox, is not considered one by physicists because it is explained by special relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:56">[01:55:56]</a>. If one twin travels at near-light speed while the other remains on Earth, the traveling twin will age slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:20">[01:54:20]</a>. The apparent paradox arises from the symmetry of relative motion, but it is resolved by recognizing that the accelerated twin changes inertial frames, while the Earth-bound twin does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:02">[01:58:02]</a>. This effect has been observed with astronauts like Scott Kelly, who aged slightly less than his twin brother Mark after spending 340 days on the International Space Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>.

## Alternative Cosmological Theories
### Block Universe
The Block Universe theory, a philosophical concept popularized by films like *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, proposes that all moments in time (past, present, and future) exist simultaneously as a fixed, unchanging block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. In this view, our consciousness simply moves through this block, giving the illusion of time passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>. While allowing for theoretical [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | time travel]], it doesn't align with the causal nature of physics.

### Gödel Universe
The Gödel Universe is a theoretical solution to Einstein's equations that describes a rotating universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>. In this model, time is cyclical, meaning it would be possible to travel back to the same point in space-time by following a specific path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. This theory, however, has several conceptual problems regarding causality and entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:33">[02:43:33]</a>.

### Multiverse Theory
The multiverse theory suggests the existence of multiple parallel universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>. This idea arises from quantum fluctuations at the beginning of the universe, leading to "bubble universes" that may even collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>. While theoretically possible, there is currently no direct observational evidence to support its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:37">[01:28:37]</a>.

### The Fate of the Universe
[[cosmological_theories_and_the_concept_of_cosmic_void | Cosmological theories]] propose several ultimate fates for the universe:
*   **Big Freeze (Heat Death)**: The universe expands indefinitely until it freezes and all energy is evenly distributed, leading to a state of maximum entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:16">[02:58:16]</a>.
*   **Big Rip**: The universe expands so rapidly that all structures, from galaxies to atoms, are torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:24">[02:58:24]</a>.
*   **Big Crunch**: The expansion of the universe eventually reverses due to gravity, causing it to contract back into a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:40">[02:58:40]</a>.
*   **Big Bounce**: A cyclical model where the universe repeatedly expands from and contracts back into a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:45">[02:58:45]</a>.
These fates depend on factors like dark energy and the overall topology of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:56">[02:58:56]</a>.
