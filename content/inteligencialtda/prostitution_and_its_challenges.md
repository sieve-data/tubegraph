The life story of Raquel Pacheco, widely known as Bruna Surfistinha, offers a profound insight into the world of prostitution and its multifaceted challenges. Her narrative covers the journey into the profession, daily experiences, the struggle for independence, and the societal perceptions she faced.

## Early Life and the Path to Prostitution

Raquel's childhood was marked by a [[role_of_family_and_its_challenges | generational gap]] with her parents, who were significantly older, and a feeling of being a "lonely child" due to a lack of same-age friends and older siblings and cousins [01:07:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. Her parents, especially her father, strongly encouraged education, investing in the "best schools" to ensure their daughters had professions and financial independence [02:11:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. However, Raquel developed a rebellious streak in adolescence, seeking attention through "doing wrong things" like smoking and skipping class [02:33:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:15">[02:33:15]</a>. This rebellion intensified when she was 13, leading her to experiment with forbidden activities [02:33:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:55">[02:33:55]</a>.

A significant turning point was her adoption, which she discovered at four or five years old [02:52:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This revelation led to "mental confusion" and a profound "feeling of rejection," which she continues to work on [02:08:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:46">[02:08:46]</a>. The adoption was not formalized with paperwork, a common practice in Brazil during the 1980s, making it impossible for her to trace her biological parents [03:41:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

By age 16-17, her relationship with her parents deteriorated drastically, marked by constant fights and her father cutting off financial support and privileges [03:32:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This led her to steal money from her parents, which provided a "total adrenaline" rush due to the danger involved [03:57:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. After being caught selling her mother's jewelry, her parents began treating her "as a stranger," locking doors and restricting her access to the house [04:54:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Her father even took her to a forum for minors, threatening her with Febem (a correctional facility for minors at the time) if she continued her behavior [05:57:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

Feeling a deep "sense of not belonging anywhere" [02:16:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a> and without friends or support, Raquel contemplated suicide [04:56:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Ultimately, she decided to run away from home at 17, viewing it as a way to "live the life I want to live" [01:07:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. With no money and little experience, she turned to a "yellow newspaper" filled with advertisements, where she found ads calling women to "prostitute themselves" [01:07:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. These ads promised "up to a thousand reais per week serving executives" and provided addresses for "nightclubs" or "private houses" [01:08:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.

## First Experiences and Daily Life in Prostitution

Raquel visited several places, including a nightclub in Santana and a massage clinic in Brooklin, but found them unsuitable due to her shyness or lack of patience for massages [01:09:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a>. She eventually settled on a house on Alameda Franca in Jardins, close to her parents' home [01:12:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. A week before turning 18, she left home, leaving a letter explaining her decision to start a new life [01:13:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

Upon starting, she had to pretend experience despite having none [01:19:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. The manager, seeing her age (17), warned her to claim 18 or 19 to clients to avoid problems [01:20:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>. She lacked basic work items like clothes and makeup, borrowing from other girls [01:20:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>. It was here that a friend, Gabi, suggested the name "Bruna," which Raquel adopted, finding it "strong, small, easy to decorate," and a way to mentally separate herself from her former identity [01:22:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.

Her first client at the house immediately recognized her inexperience but was empathetic, acting as a "psychologist" [01:26:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. He offered advice, urging her to find a "smarter way" to make money, suggesting that prostitution might not be for her due to her shyness [01:28:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>.

Life in the house involved a 60/40 split with the madam, where 60% went to the house, ostensibly for expenses like housing and food (though often of poor quality), and the remaining 40% was subject to further deductions for "security" and fines for infractions like not answering phones [01:51:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:16">[01:51:16]</a>. This system meant girls often performed "free programs" just to cover fines [01:56:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:17">[01:56:17]</a>. Prostitution, she notes, is often "very exhausting" due to constant sex, lack of affection, and dealing with various client types [01:37:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:29">[01:37:29]</a>.

### Client Interactions and Fetishes

Clients included married men (around 90% of them, as men often separate sex from love) and single men with "trauma with the size of the penis" or who found it "easier to pay than to keep a girlfriend" [01:30:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>. Bruna observed that many men viewed sex with a prostitute as not "cheating" because there was "no feelings whatsoever" [01:44:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:05">[01:44:05]</a>.

Some memorable client interactions involved:
*   **The "Baker":** A client from the same block who would arrive early in the morning, buy bread, and have quick encounters (around 10 minutes), paying for a program before going home [01:41:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:26">[01:41:26]</a>.
*   **The Neurotic Client:** A client on cocaine who, hearing a knock on the door, panicked, believing it was the police. He hid naked under the bed, requiring Bruna and the manager to physically lift the bed to get him out [02:36:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:12">[02:36:12]</a>.
*   **The Lingerie Fetishist:** A client who brought a bag of "beige mother lingerie" and made Bruna and other girls parade in them. He would then masturbate and leave, satisfied without engaging in sex, leaving the girls "laughing in despair" [02:38:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:29">[02:38:29]</a>.
*   **The Scent Fetishist:** A client who requested Bruna not to shower after her previous client, desiring to "taste the flavor" of another man's scent on her [02:41:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:05">[02:41:05]</a>. Gabi, her secretary, refused this request [02:42:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>.
*   **The Cuckold Fetishist:** A client who wanted to hide in the closet during a session, fantasizing that he was Bruna's husband being cheated on [02:42:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:30">[02:42:30]</a>. Bruna refused due to the risk of the client "coming out of the closet in the middle of the show" [02:43:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:36">[02:43:36]</a>.
*   **Dominatrix Clients:** Some clients enjoyed being "mistreated," paying to be cursed, called names, or even physically abused [02:43:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:54">[02:43:54]</a>.

## The Blog and Rise to Fame

Raquel's shyness initially made it difficult for her to engage clients [01:10:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>, but she found a unique marketing strategy: "Hi, I'm Bruna, and I do whatever you want" [01:49:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:40">[01:49:40]</a>. This phrase, combined with her dedication, led to high demand.

During downtimes at the Privê, she indulged her love for writing, maintaining a notebook where she recorded details about her clients and daily experiences, using it as a way to "vent" [01:47:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>. In early 2004, observing a lack of call girl blogs, she decided to create "The Day-to-Day of a Call Girl" [02:03:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:16">[02:03:16]</a>. Her first post was a long text about her childhood and path to prostitution [02:04:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:41">[02:04:41]</a>. Initially, she worried about exposing herself, but her strong intuition encouraged her to continue [02:07:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:52">[02:07:52]</a>.

The blog gained rapid popularity through word-of-mouth and discussions on online forums like GPGuia, where men rated call girls [02:09:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:52">[02:09:52]</a>. She used it as her primary "publicity" tool, avoiding expensive ads on escort websites [02:18:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:40">[02:18:40]</a>. The blog's anonymity initially posed a challenge as people doubted her existence, but she later added a cropped photo and phone number to prove her reality [02:14:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:51">[02:14:51]</a>.

Her fame grew when a journalist, Pedro Dória, interviewed her for an article about call girls using the internet [02:23:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:36">[02:23:36]</a>. This led to widespread media attention, with her phone "not stopped touching" [02:25:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:50">[02:25:50]</a>. She went to sleep anonymous and "woke up Bruna Surfistinha in the media" [02:26:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:09">[02:26:09]</a>. While the fame was an "opportunity," it also brought a "lot of hate" and negative comments, which she learned to ignore [02:28:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:11">[02:28:11]</a>.

## Personal Relationships and Challenges within the Profession

Raquel hired Gabi, her first friend in prostitution, as her secretary to manage her busy schedule and avoid missed calls [02:21:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:20">[02:21:20]</a>. This arrangement was efficient, operating "like a doctor's secretary's diary" [02:26:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:28">[02:26:28]</a>.

In January 2005, she met her future husband, João, who was initially a client [02:53:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:06">[02:53:06]</a>. Their relationship evolved from a client-provider dynamic to a friendship, with conversations replacing sex [02:59:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:05">[02:59:05]</a>. Raquel felt "terrible about receiving money" from him once they were friends [02:59:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:17">[02:59:17]</a>. She gave him a choice: remain friends with "Raquel" or continue as a client with "Bruna" [02:59:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:45">[02:59:45]</a>. He chose friendship, and they "fell in love and got married" in June 2005, staying together for 10 years [03:00:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:36">[03:00:36]</a>.

This relationship presented new [[challenges_in_the_entertainment_industry | challenges_in_the_entertainment_industry]]: she felt like she was "cheating" him by continuing her work, leading to emotional difficulties and reduced income as she tried to fit her schedule around his [03:01:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:13">[03:01:13]</a>. She also moved her work to the same flat where they lived, leading to neurosis as she meticulously cleaned to leave "no trace" of her clients for João [03:03:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:01">[03:03:01]</a>.

## Exit from Prostitution and New Life

Raquel consumed cocaine for about a year and three months during her time in prostitution, experiencing a near-overdose that she attributes to a spiritual or delirious encounter where she was warned it was her "last chance" [02:45:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:34">[02:45:34]</a>. This experience prompted her to quit cocaine and marijuana, though she continued to smoke cigarettes [02:47:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:24">[02:47:24]</a>.

By 2005, she decided it would be her last year in prostitution, aiming to live off her writing [02:50:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:19">[02:50:19]</a>. Her relationship with João accelerated this plan, and she decided to retire on her 21st birthday, October 28, 2005, viewing it as a "gift" to herself [03:04:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:29">[03:04:29]</a>.

After her retirement, her blog garnered the attention of Marcelo Duarte, a publisher, who suggested turning it into a book [03:05:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:55">[03:05:55]</a>. She initially declined due to lack of time, but he proposed having someone transcribe her conversations and incorporate her blog texts [03:08:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:06">[03:08:06]</a>. The book, *What I Learned from Bruna Surfistinha*, was published in late 2005 and became a bestseller [03:08:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:29">[03:08:29]</a>. It was translated into multiple languages and later adapted into a successful film (2011) and a series (2016) [03:09:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:51">[03:09:51]</a>. The film faced challenges in securing sponsorship due to brands' reluctance to associate with the "image of prostitution" [03:19:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:31">[03:19:31]</a>.

## Reflections on Prostitution

Raquel considers the decision to run away from home to enter prostitution as the "most difficult moment" of her life [03:47:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:20">[03:47:20]</a>. She emphasizes the danger and uncertainty she faced, acknowledging that her life "could go very wrong" [03:47:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:49">[03:47:49]</a>.

She now has two daughters, Elis and Maria, and describes motherhood as a "very delicious" but challenging phase, especially with twins [03:37:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:38">[03:37:38]</a>. Despite the passage of 17 years since leaving prostitution, she notes that many people still perceive her only through those three years of her life [03:20:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:07">[03:20:07]</a>. Brands still shy away from her due to the "hypocrisy" surrounding her past, highlighting ongoing societal prejudice [03:21:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:30">[03:21:30]</a>.

Her experience in [[challenges_in_the_entertainment_industry | reality TV]] (The Farm) was intense, teaching her about living with very different people [03:33:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:31">[03:33:31]</a>. She reflects on her childhood desire to be a psychologist and how her experiences in prostitution, where men often sought someone to talk to and vent, provided a unique form of "psychologist" interaction [02:26:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:20">[02:26:20]</a>.

Raquel believes that prostitution, despite its complexities, offers the "most faithful human relationship" because "no one fools anyone there" [01:53:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>. She acknowledges that her chosen path, driven partly by a desire to "hurt my father" and [[challenging_societal_norms_and_values | provoke him]] [03:57:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, was a way to live intensely and make the most of it [03:26:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:15">[03:26:15]</a>. Her most recent autobiography, *Eternal Bruna Surfistinha*, details her life from birth to motherhood, providing a comprehensive account of her journey [03:13:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:02">[03:13:02]</a>.
