*American Psycho*, both the book and the film, has long been a lightning rod for [[controversy_surrounding_american_psycho | controversy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Much of the [[controversy_surrounding_american_psycho | controversy]] surrounding *American Psycho* stems from varying perceptions of its intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The film is often viewed as a [[american_psycho_as_a_critique_on_consumerism | critique on the consumerism]] and superficiality prevalent in 1980s yuppie culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Satirizing 1980s Yuppie Culture and Consumerism

*American Psycho* is set in 1988, during the height of the wealthy Wall Streeter "yuppie" era, embodied by the character Patrick Bateman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The film [[american_psycho_as_a_critique_on_consumerism | satirizes the shallow consumer lifestyle]] of this period, reveling in its excesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This is depicted through extravagant dinners, specific menu items like "grilled free-range rabbit with french fries," and Bateman's overly indulgent morning routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Patrick Bateman's obsession with his status among wealthy Wall Streeters is a central theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This includes his efforts to secure reservations at trendy restaurants like Dorsia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> and his meticulous grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Bateman repeatedly references Donald Trump and Ivana Trump, as Trump was synonymous with excess in the 1980s, representing the "ultimate yuppie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Like Trump's described 1985 apartment, which shimmers with "liquid gold," Bateman is fixated on the "minutia" that defines his elite status, from bedsheets to skincare routines and business cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Christian Bale's performance as Bateman is highlighted as an acting showcase that turns absurdity into high drama, especially in trivial moments like reacting to a business card's font <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Bale "nails the satirical tone" by making such minutia both nonsensical and sadly believable for a status-conscious yuppie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Everything in Bateman's life is commodified and used as a "token of his perceived superiority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The film uses material objects to comment on the superficiality of its characters, who are "vapid and self-absorbed" and more concerned with appearance than real-world conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Dinner conversations are punctuated by mentions of global issues, which Bateman only uses for "one-upsmanship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. When confronted by a homeless person, Bateman brutally stabs him instead of offering help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This highlights the film's argument that in a society preoccupied with acquiring goods, "nobody cares much about any of the other people around them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The film views class as a competition, reflecting Thorstein Veblen's theories on the "leisure class" and "conspicuous consumption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Veblen describes conspicuous consumption as using goods to demonstrate "pecuniary strength" or "reputability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Bateman consistently defines himself in relation to others, hating Paul Allen for fancier restaurants and business cards, or thinking he's better than Marcus due to a "slightly better haircut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. He flaunts his wealth and knowledge, such as lecturing prostitutes on Genesis and Whitney Houston, to prove his superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The film suggests that beneath Bateman's desire for luxury lies a "literal bloodlust," presenting consumer capitalism as a "bloodsport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Bateman's murderous inclinations are the "truth lurking beneath the facade of his superficial lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Initially, Bateman states there is "nothing to him," just an "abstraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. However, by succumbing to murder, he "becomes whole," acknowledging that his pursuit of money merely hides his "baser desire to kill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This suggests that the "true nature of the consumer capitalist is well, a cold-blooded serial killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Satire of Masculinity and Sexism

The film's violence, particularly towards women and the lower class, has been accused of glorifying "grotesque deaths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. However, screenwriter Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron argue that *American Psycho* is a "feminist film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> and a "great parody of masculinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

They state it's a [[perception_of_masculinity_and_sexism_in_american_psycho | satire about how men compete with each other]] and how, in this "hyper-real universe," women are "even less important than your tan or your suit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Harron clarifies that the film was "accused of being sexist" but was "always an attack and satire of sexism and of male ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The film showcases the "cavalier attitudes many men have for women," exemplified by Bateman's belief that "there are no girls with good personalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. He Lords over women's bodies as if he owns them, dictating what his assistant wears and paying women to follow his instructions in bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Bateman feels he can do as he pleases with a woman's body, including "killing, mutilating, and even eating them," believing he can get away with it—a "cold cynical truth" the film suggests is accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## The Ambiguity of Reality and Satirical Intent

The film blurs the line between reality and fantasy as Patrick descends into madness and goes on a killing spree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Despite murdering "dozens of people," nobody seems to care, and "there are seemingly no bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. When Bateman confesses to Paul Allen's murder, he is told Paul is "still alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This raises questions: "Did Patrick actually kill anybody? Was it all in his head? Or does it even matter?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Patrick is frequently mistaken for other people, such as Paul mistaking him for "Great Fan Marcus" or his lawyer thinking he's "Davis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This highlights the "artifice" of his and his friends' lifestyles, where everyone is "the same and completely interchangeable," and only material possessions truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## The Paradoxical Impact of Satire

Despite being a "savage [[american_psycho_as_a_critique_on_consumerism | critique on consumerism]]," the film's audience often finds Patrick Bateman and his lifestyle "undeniably seductive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This is evidenced by media that replicates Bateman's grooming style, tracks his dining habits, or offers tours of his apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This fascination arises because "parody seems to have a tendency to offer competing interpretations," both legitimizing and subverting its subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

While subversive, *American Psycho* "does revel in excess," showcasing Bateman's handsome appearance, success with women, beautiful apartment, and well-paying job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Furthermore, the film often plays Bateman's "more monstrous acts as comedic" or "cuts away from them entirely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. For example, Paul Allen's murder is "played as comedy" to Huey Lewis and the News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, and Christine's murder only shows the "net result" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This allows the audience to "identify more with the glitz and glamour" and "let him off the hook for his more gruesome misdeeds," potentially "undermining its own satirical depth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The film's impact seems to be upholding the "surface value lifestyle" it rebels against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, leading to Bateman being "lotted as an anti-establishment antihero" despite his monstrous acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

This paradoxical reception may be a "metatextual turn" and the actual point of the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Just as Patrick Bateman confesses his crimes and people either mishear him as discussing "mergers and acquisitions" or dismiss his confessions as jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, *American Psycho* itself has been misinterpreted as "misogynistic and pro-consumer" or treated as "a joke and a parody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The issues it rails against—"status-obsessed society, sexism and wealth inequality"—remain relevant today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

As Patrick Bateman says at the film's conclusion, "This confession has meant nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Likewise, *American Psycho* "cynically and truthfully ridicules a society run amok but knows deep down that this confession too will mean nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. The film is deemed "deep," even if its impact, like Bateman's confession, "probably doesn't matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
