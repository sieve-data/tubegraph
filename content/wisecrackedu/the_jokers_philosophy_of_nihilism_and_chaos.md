The Joker, first appearing in 1940’s *Batman #1* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, is often considered Batman's most iconic villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Inspired by Victor Hugo's Gwynplaine from the 1928 film adaptation of *The Man Who Laughs* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, his motives have varied from sadistic to mercenary to inexplicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Despite numerous creative minds working on the character, his outlook on the world has remained remarkably consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, representing an extreme form of a reaction many people feel towards the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He is often described as everyone's favorite [[jokers_philosophy_of_chaos_and_nihilism | nihilist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Origin and Consistent Outlook

The first account of the Joker's origin was revealed in *Detective Comics #168* in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Most versions of his [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film | origin story]] follow a similar plotline: a two-bit villain, the Red Hood, loses a fight with Batman, falls into a vat of skin-bleaching and hair-brightening chemicals, and emerges transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Alan Moore's 1986 graphic novel *The Killing Joke* made the Joker's origin more tragic, portraying him as a reluctant villain who lost his humanity after "One Bad Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This day included failing as a stand-up comic, being informed of his pregnant wife's death, being framed by the mob, and then falling into disfiguring chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Even though *The Killing Joke* is not strictly canonical and the Joker himself indicates uncertainty about his past, this depressing version of his origins has largely been adopted in comics, animated series, and games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## The "One Bad Day" and Existential Crisis

Both Batman and the Joker's lives are responses to traumatic, world-view-shattering events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. These events represent an [[the_influence_of_existential_and_philosophical_ideas_on_the_jokers_character | existential crisis]] that questions how one responds when life destroys a sense of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

While Batman reacts to his parents' death by upholding conventional morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, the Joker's "One Bad Day" leads him to passionately embrace meaninglessness and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He believes that if [[jokers_philosophy_of_chaos_and_nihilism | moral nihilism]] is correct, then nothing is inherently right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Embracing Meaninglessness: Moral Nihilism

According to French [[the_influence_of_existential_and_philosophical_ideas_on_the_jokers_character | existentialist]] philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, recognizing the meaninglessness of existence forces individuals to realize they are responsible for creating their own meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This choice of how to deal with the loss of meaning animates the entire Batman universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
*   **Batman** chooses to uphold conventional morality as a vigilante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **The Joker** chooses to abandon it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Two-Face** symbolizes the split, literally flipping a coin to decide his moral stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The premise of *The Killing Joke* revolves around the Joker's attempt to turn Commissioner Gordon into another version of himself by giving him a similarly traumatic day, aiming to prove that even the best individuals are "one bad day away from becoming, well, whatever the Joker is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## The Relationship with Batman

[[comparison_of_batman_and_the_jokers_responses_to_trauma_and_meaninglessness | Batman and the Joker]] are locked in an [[the_influence_of_existential_and_philosophical_ideas_on_the_jokers_character | existential struggle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Batman tries to convince the Joker to accept conventional morality, while the Joker attempts to seduce Batman into abandoning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

In the 1989 film *Batman*, Jack Napier, the future Joker, is depicted as the original killer of Batman's parents, and Batman later causes Napier to fall into the chemical vat, thus creating the Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This suggests they "gave birth to each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## The Dark Knight and Baudrillard's Influence

Heath Ledger's Joker in Nolan's *The Dark Knight* (2005) was an elemental force of [[jokers_philosophy_of_chaos_and_nihilism | chaos]] with no consistent [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film | origin story]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. He was more akin to a demon summoned by Batman's enemies, one they ultimately couldn't control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. In this iteration, the Joker's presence in Gotham is presented as Batman's fault; by introducing oppressive justice and order, Batman throws Gotham's moral universe out of balance, creating an opportunity for a new kind of chaos and evil to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

This concept aligns with the philosophy of French sociologist Jean Baudrillard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. In *The Transparency of Evil*, Baudrillard argues that the moral progress Batman seeks is impossible because his pursuit of order creates more extreme versions for criminals to challenge and subvert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Trying to sanitize Gotham of evil paradoxically creates a "supergerm" or "autoimmunity disease" in the form of the Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

Baudrillard defines evil not as the opposite of good, but as a radical indifference to good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This perfectly describes the Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Destroying the Concept of Good

Unlike other supervillains who merely cause bad things to happen, the Joker has a more sinister goal: to completely destroy the concept of what "good" even means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. He aims to seduce characters like Batman and Gordon into abandoning their moral foundations and doing things they would never imagine, thereby corrupting their understanding of "goodness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. His passion for breaking down confidence in the division between good and evil is what makes him intriguing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>; he doesn't combat good with its opposite, he destroys good itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

In *The Dark Knight*, Batman wins the fight, but the Joker wins the argument, as the once idealistic Harvey Dent becomes completely indifferent to the distinction between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The Joker's objective is to expose that human pretenses to love and morality are phony, revealing people to be more self-serving than they let on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## The "Pathologically Sane" Villain

It's a "cop-out" to classify the Joker as merely mentally ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. His common classification as insane seems to indicate a lack of understanding of his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The source of his violence is not a psychiatric problem, but an [[the_influence_of_existential_and_philosophical_ideas_on_the_jokers_character | existential one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. He is described as "pathologically sane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, having seen the fragility of conventional morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. He truly believes that no one is more than "one sufficiently bad day away from total depravity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Humor as a Nihilistic Tool

The Joker doesn't just abandon traditional moral codes; he subverts them with a sinister form of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. His clown-like appearance, permanent grin, and slapstick-based murder weapons are his gimmick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While historically a mere gimmick, since *The Killing Joke* (1988) and *The Dark Knight* (2008), this humor has taken on a darker undertone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. He enjoys doing horrifying acts because they are "funny to him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>; from his perspective, everything is trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

His attempts to tempt people into acts that upset their own sense of right and wrong, and reveal their hypocrisy, speak to the very heart of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer noted that humor arises from "the sudden apprehension of an incongruity between a concept and the real objects that have been thought through it in some relation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

The idea of finding humor in [[jokers_philosophy_of_chaos_and_nihilism | nihilism]] is not new, and in smaller doses, it can be a survival mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Philosopher John Marmysz argues that laughing at the void can be healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>:
> "Humor arises when we are confronted by meaninglessness and instead of being defeated by it, we manage to transcend it and see it as something worth laughing about." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

The Joker is an actively and joyfully fanatical [[jokers_philosophy_of_chaos_and_nihilism | nihilist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. He sees it as his duty to confront imposed moral order with the reality of [[jokers_philosophy_of_chaos_and_nihilism | chaos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. His life revolves around identifying incongruities between what people claim to be (moral, righteous, good citizens) and what they actually are (selfish, savage creatures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>— and he enjoys it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## The Killing Joke and Joker Venom

The Joker believes that conventional morality and social structures are flimsy and weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, and that no one is more than one bad day away from abandoning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. His entire career as a villain focuses on giving people that "one bad day" he believes they need to become like him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This is his "killing joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

His signature weapon, Joker venom, is a deadly gas that forces victims to laugh themselves to death while their face contorts into a rictus grin similar to his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This weapon, used since his debut in 1940's *Batman #1* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, symbolizes his greatest pleasure and obsession: proving everyone is capable of becoming what he is, both morally and physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Relatability of the Joker's Philosophy

It is difficult not to glamorize the Joker partly due to his longevity and the affection developed for the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Given the scale of human suffering, injustice, hypocrisy, and greed, it's easy to relate to his commitment to proving that humanity is not as noble as it pretends to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

While he is not heroic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a> (and seemingly heroic actions, like turning against Red Skull in *Batman & Captain America* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a> or executing Lex Luthor in *Infinite Crisis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, are given plausible selfish motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>), the Joker remains an effective villain because "we all have a little bit of him in us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. People are suspicious of others' moral codes, liable to fixate on hypocrisy, and have moments where they "just kind of want to watch the world burn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
