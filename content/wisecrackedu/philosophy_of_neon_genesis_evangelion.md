*Neon Genesis Evangelion* (Eva) is an intricately complex narrative that, beneath its surface depiction of the end of the world and teenagers piloting giant biomechanical monsters against alien-angel-robot entities, delves into profound themes of psychosexual development, intimacy, unconscious human motivation, and the inherent difficulties of being a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. At its core, the series explores the philosophical concept of hedgehogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

This analysis focuses on the original twenty-six-episode series and the films *End of Evangelion* and *Death and Rebirth* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Series Overview

In the year 2015, Earth faces attacks from unearthly beings known as Angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. To combat these threats, humanity developed powerful robots called Evas, which synchronize with their pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. However, the Evas are more than they appear; they are former Angels imbued with human souls, specifically the souls of the pilots' mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Shinji, Asuka, and Rei (a clone) pilot these Evas, aiming to save the world while confronting their personal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Rei, by bonding the DNA of the original Angels Adam and Lilith, ultimately becomes a being embodying the consciousness of all humanity, foreshadowing the end of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

## Eschatology and Mysticism

The title *Neon Genesis Evangelion* itself carries deep meaning: "Neon" from the Greek "neos" means "new," "Genesis" refers to a beginning and the opening book of the Bible, and "Evangelion" signifies the Gospel or "good news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:40">[02:43:40]</a>. Thus, the title suggests a "new telling of the gospel: genesis," or a re-imagining of the Book of Genesis with technology, brooding, and sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

The series is rich with [[religious_symbolism_in_evangelion | religious iconography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Explicit references include the Dead Sea Scrolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a> and a "type 666 firewall" installed on the Magi system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Creatures named Angels, two of which are Adam and Lilith, feature prominently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Lilith, unlike the expected Eve, is Adam's female counterpart in Jewish folklore, often described as a mother of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. In *Evangelion*, humans are the descendants of Lilith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

Christian elements also appear, such as the NERV supercomputer network, the Magi system, which has three parts named after the three wise men: Casper, Balthasar, and Melchior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

However, the majority of the [[religious_symbolism_in_evangelion | religious imagery]] is rooted in Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Kabbalah is a mystical practice that seeks religious revelation and sacred knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Many Angels in Eva are directly drawn from texts in Judaism's extended universe, including the Zohar, the Talmud, and the Book of Enoch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Other names, like Ramiel, Sachiel, and Matarael, use the "el" suffix from theosophy, a Hebrew word for God, to signify a divine connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

In Kabbalistic tradition, the first being is Adam Kadmon, a being of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This mirrors Eva's first Angel, also named Adam, who explodes in the Second Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This cataclysm kills half the planet's population and turns the oceans red, akin to a Revelation-style event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. This destruction recalls a Kabbalistic event called the Shevirat ha-Kelim, or the "breaking of vessels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This concept describes an initial universal unity that shattered, resulting in the separation and diversity of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>, akin to a theological Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

The purpose of Kabbalah is Tikkun ha-Olam, or the "restoration of the world," traditionally achieved through good deeds and prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. In *Evangelion*, this is taken literally: the ethical call is the reunification of the world's fragmented parts, known as the Sefirot, which are depicted as the Tree of Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. The random circles appearing around Eva Unit 01 when attacked by manufactured Angels symbolize the fulfillment of this sacred Kabbalistic duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. This reunification of the Sefirot aims to recreate the universe as a complete whole, which, paradoxically, destroys the individuality and separation that defines life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Many characters in the series pursue this goal of literally reunifying the world by consolidating all consciousnesses into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. This ultimately occurs when Adam and Lilith's DNA combine within Rei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

## The Hedgehog's Dilemma

Beyond its action and visual spectacle, *Evangelion* achieves its deepest impact by exploring themes of sadness, isolation, and [[the_concept_of_individuality_and_isolation_in_evangelion | the human condition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. The world, having lost half its population, is a desolate place, reflecting the show's pervasive sense of despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

The characters' struggles with misery and intimacy are explained through [[the_hedgehogs_dilemma_and_its_role_in_evangelion | the hedgehog's dilemma]], a parable from Arthur Schopenhauer's *Parega and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Schopenhauer compares humans to hedgehogs: they desire warmth but cannot get too close without injuring each other with their quills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. They must either maintain distance and remain cold or learn to live without the warmth of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

[[the_hedgehogs_dilemma_and_its_role_in_evangelion | This dilemma]] is a central guiding theme in Eva. Ritsuko explicitly explains it in Episode 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>: "Even though a hedgehog may wanna become close with another hedgehog, the closer they get the more they injure each other with their spines. It's the same with some humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Episode 4 is even titled "The Hedgehog's Dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. This desire to avoid being hurt creates a barrier between people, leading to a world of despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

The show explores this further in Episode 16, "Sickness Unto Death," a reference to Soren Kierkegaard's concept of despair, which aligns with Schopenhauer's ideas of existential loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Characters like Asuka, who pilots her Eva to find meaning, fear being alone and use piloting to draw people closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. Gendo, Shinji's father, struggles to show love, believing he doesn't deserve it and rejecting the world to avoid pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

In *The World as Will and Representation*, Schopenhauer posits that life is suffering because reality is composed of will and representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. For him, the nature of reality is unity, and peace would exist without the struggle of communication between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. Suffering results from [[the_concept_of_individuality_and_isolation_in_evangelion | individuality]]; to be human is to suffer because perfect communication and understanding are impossible, and this struggle to connect causes pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. The universe is one entity, but each individual ego perceives the world from its unique vantage point—its "representation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Anguish, fragmentation, alienation, and [[the_concept_of_individuality_and_isolation_in_evangelion | isolation]] stem from each person's independent will and the disconnect between desire and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

This separation of wills is manifested in the show as "AT-fields," which represent the unique human soul or ego that separates individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. It is a barrier preventing true connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Characters frequently discuss what it means to be an ego and have a body, especially as their consciousness fades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. The desire to "melt with and fill each other" and become one is explicitly stated as "the instrumentality," stemming from the understanding that humans cannot live alone but are also inherently unique, making life hard, sad, and empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

## Psychoanalysis

*Evangelion* explicitly uses [[freudian_psychoanalysis_in_evangelion | Freudian terms]], ideas, and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. Episode 19, "Introjection," refers to the Freudian term explaining how people adopt characteristics from those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Episode 20, "Weaving a Story 2: Oral Stage," connects to Freud's Oral Stage of psychosexual development, which deals with a child's weaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. Children weaned too early might become sociopathic and out of touch with emotions, while those weaned too late might become neurotic and overly dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

All Eva pilots are motherless children (or so they believe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. Shinji's mother is the soul of Unit 01, and part of Asuka's mother's soul is in Unit 02 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. The Evas use these souls to bond with their pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. The pilots' reactions to their mothers reflect their dispositions; they are all mourning a lost love object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. Rei, as an artificial being, experiences melancholia rather than mourning because she has no real loss, lacking a "mama soul" to put into a robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. Mourning occurs when one knows what is lost, whereas melancholia is a deep sadness stemming from an unknown missing element, requiring psychotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. This is why the final episodes function as a psychotherapy session within Shinji's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

The Magi supercomputers, which contain the mind of Dr. Naoko Akagi, reflect Freud's tri-part model of the human unconscious: the controlling scientist as the ego, the mother as the punishing superego, and the woman as the sexual id <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. Episode 18, "Ambivalence," highlights a [[freudian_psychoanalysis_in_evangelion | Freudian idea]] where people can feel intense hate and love simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. Shinji, for instance, constantly expresses hatred for his father but pilots the Eva to gain his praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>, explaining in Episode 12 that he pilots to hear his father's words of praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.

The series also explores Eros (the life drive) and Thanatos (the death drive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. Freud's pleasure principle dictates a general inclination to avoid pain and maximize pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. Shinji's lament in Episode 16, "This world is filled with too much pain and suffering to keep going on," reflects this desire to minimize suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>. This aligns with Schopenhauer's ideas about will and struggle: suffering is inevitable when sharing a world with others whose desires conflict with one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

For Seele, NERV, and individuals like Gendo and Shinji, peace is sought through instrumentalization, where all human consciousness combines into a primordial soup called LCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. This desire to join a unified whole and escape self-concerns is linked to Freud's Death Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. The death drive represents a desire to return to tranquility, the peace and harmony of the womb, or the "end of everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. Episode 25 directly addresses this with the text: "the case of Shinji Ikari, the boy who wished for death of his own will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. Gendo explains that instrumentality is "a return to the state of beginning...a return to the primal womb that we lost so long ago. Souls and minds will become one, attaining eternal balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>, linking it to Lilith and Tikkun ha-Olam, the restoration of the world through reunification with the primordial being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. Seele and NERV work towards this death drive, relying on Shinji to become the "arc for humanity" that allows them to escape loneliness and [[the_concept_of_individuality_and_isolation_in_evangelion | isolation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The human response to [[the_hedgehogs_dilemma_and_its_role_in_evangelion | the hedgehog's dilemma]] is to seek tranquility by returning to the womb, which is ultimately a desire for death and escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>. However, Kaworu, a non-human character, offers an alternative: acceptance of vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. Kaworu sacrifices his individual desires and will for Shinji's life, demonstrating unguarded and absolute love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. He advises that while keeping others at a distance prevents betrayal, it necessitates enduring loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>: "Man cannot completely erase this sadness because all men are fundamentally alone. Pain is something that man must endure in his heart..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.

In the final episodes and film, Shinji initially accepts instrumentalization but then rejects it upon realizing he would lose his self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>: "Because there are others, I can perceive myself as an individual! If I am alone, then I will be the same without others! For if this world is only of me, then there will be no difference between me and nothing!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. He affirms, "I am me. I want to be myself. I want to continue existing in this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>, renouncing a world of primordial soup and shared minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. Shinji chooses a world where people can be hurt, where there is separation, individual selves, wills, desires, and pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. He confronts the drive towards inorganic existence and accepts the inevitability of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. This choice, while accepting pain, also opens the door for hope and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>. His first act after rejecting instrumentality—choking Asuka, followed by her stroking his face—symbolizes the world they chose: one of violence and pain, but also love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>.

The theological, psychological, and philosophical elements of *Evangelion* all grapple with the concept of "lack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>. In psychology, lack, as explored by Jacques Lacan, is the "missing center at the heart of our existence," the gap between representation and the world itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>. This lack manifests as scarcity in relationships, failing connections, or distance between family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>. *Evangelion* consistently weaves a plot that explores the visceral reality of humanity's often disappointing existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>.

In the end, with Rei (meaning "soul," "ghost," or "zero") in Unit 00, Shinji (the "first real person") in Unit 01, and Asuka (the "other") in Unit 02, the narrative culminates with Shinji and Asuka as a new Adam and Eve, signifying a "new Beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>.
