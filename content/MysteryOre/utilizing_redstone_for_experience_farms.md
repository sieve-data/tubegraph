In the world of Minecraft, gaining experience points is essential for enchanting tools, armor, and weapons. One highly effective method is by turning natural spawners into experience farms using Redstone, which automates the process and increases efficiency. This article delves into the intricacies of utilizing Redstone to optimize experience farms with practical examples and strategies.

## Finding the Spawner

The process begins by locating a spawner. While traditional methods like using the pie chart from the debug menu are obsolete, modern tactics have emerged. One such method involves constructing an x-ray machine using trapdoors and levers to see beneath the ground, thus helping identify the location of a spawner. In the discussed session, an x-ray machine revealed a [[building_a_skeleton_spawner_farm | skeleton spawner]], which is particularly advantageous (considered the best among available spawners) due to the valuable drops it provides like bones and arrows. This forms the foundation of the experience farm strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Building the Mob Farm

Once the spawner is located, the next step involves constructing a [[creating_automated_mob_farms | basic mob farm]]. The spawner should be manipulated to ensure that the mobs spawn and are funneled through a water channel, moving them systematically towards a designated collection point. The skeletons, for example, are pushed into a tube by water for a controlled drop. The goal is to lower their health, ideally, to half a heart, making them easier to kill manually later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Enhancing with Redstone Components

The real optimization begins by introducing Redstone. Essential Redstone components for enhancing the farm functionality include Pistons, pressure plates, buttons, and more depending on the desired features. For instance, a bubble elevator can be implemented, using Pistons, Soul Sand, and magma blocks, enabling efficient movement up and down the structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Auto Kill Mode

One of the sophisticated Redstone circuits set within the farm is the "Auto Kill Mode." This function lights a campfire to automatically kill mobs without destroying valuable drops. It can be toggled off to return to manual killing mode, allowing flexibility based on the player's current needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Transformation into Strays

Using Redstone mechanisms, skeletons can also be converted into Strays for acquiring arrows of slowness. This conversion is achieved by pushing skeletons through powdered snow using pistons. The process enhances the versatility of the farm, providing more than just experience points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Hoppers and Item Elevator

To address [[designing_effective_item_storage_systems | storage and drops sorting]], Hoppers and item elevators are crucial. Redstone compares and sorts drops like bones, arrows, and other miscellaneous items into designated chests. This ensures that all resources from the farm are efficiently processed and stored, preparing them for future use or trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Storage System and Aesthetic Considerations

Concluding the setup, a sophisticated storage system is linked to the farm, using item sorters to separate and categorize different drops. Having these systems in place allows players to manage their resources effortlessly. Additionally, aesthetic enhancements, such as constructing a large spawner-shaped room encasing the setup, not only serve functional purposes but also [[building_and_decorating_an_enchanting_setup | visually signify the purpose of the structure]], embodying the union of creativity and utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

> [!info] Conclusion
> The integration of Redstone into experience farms significantly boosts efficiency and productivity. By automatizing mob killing and drop collection through Redstone mechanisms, players can maximize their experience gains, streamline resource collection, and enjoy enhanced gameplay with minimal manual intervention. This strategic approach not only optimizes time spent in-game but also allows for innovative and creative design implementations.
