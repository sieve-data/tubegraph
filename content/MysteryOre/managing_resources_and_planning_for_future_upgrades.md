In the hectic world of Minecraft, efficient resource management and planning for future upgrades are crucial for success, especially when playing in hardcore mode. The first episode of this series provides several insights into these practices during the construction of a [[building_a_starter_house_in_minecraft_hardcore | starter house]].

## Resource Gathering: A Foundational Step

The initial stages of setting up a base require a strategic approach to resource gathering. In the video, the player emphasizes the importance of collecting essential materials like iron and wood, highlighting their pivotal role in crafting tools and building structures.

### Iron Acquisition

Early in the game, finding and mining iron is necessary for creating stronger tools and armor. The player demonstrates this by crafting an iron pickaxe, which allows for more efficient mining and enhances survivability, crucial in a [[safety_precautions_in_hardcore_gameplay | hardcore setting]], where death is permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Wood Selection

The choice of wood for building—aesthetic and practical—is evident. The player opts for dark woods like Spruce and dark oak to construct a cozy, log cabin-style house. However, procuring these woods requires venturing out and transporting materials back to the building site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Building Considerations and Planning

### Choosing the Right Location

Selecting a suitable location for building is critical. In this series, the player chooses a snow biome for its unique aesthetic, despite its lack of resources, demonstrating a willingness to travel for materials while prioritizing the desired look and feel of the base [[exploring_and_navigating_different_biomes | exploring different biomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Designing the Starter House

Practicality meets creativity as the player plans and constructs the starter house. The inclusion of features like a stone chimney not only enhances the aesthetic but also requires significant resource investment and planning to ensure all necessary materials, like stone, are on hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Preparing for Future Needs

### Expanding Resource Collection

As the project progresses, the player acknowledges the shortfall of resources, such as Spruce wood, prompting further resource missions. It's a recognition that initial calculations often fall short, and continuous planning and adaptation are required [[resource_gathering_and_survival_strategies | resource gathering and survival strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Planning for Farming

Planning extends to farming, not just for sustenance, but for strategic purposes like creating a tall, visually impactful chimney smoke. By planting and watering seeds, the player sets up a future source to craft specialized items like hay bales needed for taller smoke effects [[crafting_and_farming_in_minecraft_gameplay | crafting and farming in Minecraft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Crafting Future Upgrades

The anticipation of future needs leads to crafting items like stained glass windows, which require sand and dye. These aesthetic choices are planned well in advance, considering necessary resources and crafting processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
