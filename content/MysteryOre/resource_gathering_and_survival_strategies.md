## Building a Starter Base

In the video, the narrator discusses the idea of building a base in a snow biome, which is slightly unconventional due to its resource disadvantages but preferred for aesthetic reasons.

**Biome Selection:**

The cabin construction requires specific types of wood: Spruce and Dark Oak. The narrator embarks on a journey to collect these essential materials:

**Wood Acquisition:**
- The journey involves traveling to different terrains for Dark Oak (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>), and there’s a consideration of responsible resource gathering by avoiding “floating trees,” which underscores a kind of ethical gameplay.
- For Spruce, the emphasis is on selectively harvesting trees with a preference for areas that are less visibly affected by deforestation ([[resource_gathering_and_farming_techniques | resource gathering techniques]]) (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>).

## Ingredient and Material Sourcing

Beyond wood, other materials and food sources are necessary for survival. 

**Stone and Iron:**
- The narrator notes the need for stone and iron to supplement the building materials and for crafting armor, which demands a return to the spawn area for further collection ([[mining_strategies_and_resource_gathering | mining strategies]]) (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>).

**Wheat for Fireplace:**
