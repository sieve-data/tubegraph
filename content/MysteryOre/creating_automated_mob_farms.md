Automated mob farms have become a staple for Minecraft players seeking efficient ways to gather resources and experience. Over time, various methods have emerged to optimize these farms, and in recent content, we delve into the intricacies of setting up an efficient skeleton farm using modern techniques.

## Locating a Dungeon Spawner

The first step in creating an automated mob farm is locating a suitable dungeon spawner. In the past, players could use the pie graph in the debug menu to find dungeons, but this method is no longer effective [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">00:00:10</a>]. Instead, players now employ an X-ray machine setup to locate dungeons beneath the surface. By strategically flipping trapdoors and levers, the underground world becomes visible, allowing players to spot potential spawners [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">00:00:22</a>].

## Building the Basic Farm

Once a spawner is located, typically a skeleton spawner for its useful drops, the next step is converting it into a functioning farm [[building_a_skeleton_spawner_farm | Building a Skeleton Spawner Farm]]. This involves creating a water flow mechanism that pushes skeletons into an elevator tube where they drop to a predefined area, ideally landing at half a heart for easy elimination [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">00:02:01</a>]. Adjustments, such as increasing tube height, are sometimes necessary to accommodate additional features [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">00:02:14</a>].

## Integrating Redstone Automation

Key to automating the farm is the introduction of Redstone components. A bubble elevator can be integrated to facilitate easy movement up and down within the farm using soul sand and magma blocks [[utilizing_redstone_for_experience_farms | Utilizing Redstone for Experience Farms]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">00:02:48</a>]. Additionally, an auto-kill mode can be set up with a Redstone circuit and campfires to automatically dispatch skeletons while retrieving their items [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">00:03:57</a>].

## Enhancing with Conversion Features

To maximize resource variety, skeletons can be converted into strays by pushing them into powdered snow, which then provides slowness arrows when they are defeated [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">00:04:45</a>]. This conversion process involves using cobwebs to ensure skeletons remain in the snow long enough to transform [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">00:05:03</a>].

## Storage and Item Sorting

Efficient storage systems are crucial as the farm generates large quantities of items. By incorporating item elevators and sorters, bones, arrows, and slowness arrows can be automatically categorized and stored in dedicated chests [[designing_effective_item_storage_systems | Designing Effective Item Storage Systems]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">00:07:35</a>]. This allows for seamless management and access to collected resources.

## Creating a Protective Structure

The final touch involves enclosing the storage area with a protective and thematic structure. This can involve creative designs such as constructing a replica of a spawner or a skeleton statue to serve as both a functional and aesthetic feature. This not only shields the area but adds a personal flair to the build [[building_and_decorating_an_enchanting_setup | Building and Decorating an Enchanting Setup]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">00:11:06</a>].
