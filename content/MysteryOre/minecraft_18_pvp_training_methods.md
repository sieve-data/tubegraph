Minecraft 1.8 is a beloved version of the game, known particularly for its classic PvP mechanics that many players still enjoy. Advancing in Minecraft 1.8 PvP requires mastering several sub-skills, and a recent video broke down a week-long training regimen aimed at improving proficiency in PvP. Below is a detailed overview of the various training methods discussed.

## Clicks Per Second (CPS)

CPS, or clicks per second, is a significant factor in Minecraft 1.8 PvP. The goal is to enhance speed and endurance when clicking. The training regimen included:

- **10 Second Sprints:** Focus on bursts of high-speed clicking.
- **30 Second Mid-Distance Races:** Sustain moderate speed over these short intervals.
- **60 Second Long-Distance Races:** Build endurance for extended periods of clicking.

The trainer improved from a baseline of 5 CPS to 6.3 CPS by the end of the week, marking a 26% increase in performance [[improving_clicks_per_second_cps_in_minecraft | in CPS improvement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Hotkeying

For hotkeying, avoiding the scroll wheel in favor of keybinds is emphasized due to its speed and precision. A custom-built redstone dropper system was employed:

- **Redstone Machine:** This device randomly dispenses colored wool blocks. The objective is to hotkey to the corresponding inventory slot as quickly as possible.
- The machine's speed can be adjusted, allowing for gradual increases in difficulty throughout the week [[hotkeying_techniques_for_minecraft_pvp | with hotkeying approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Speed Bridging

Speed bridging is essential for quickly navigating terrain:

- **Training Methods:** The focus was on four types â€“ straight, diagonal, straight staircasing, and diagonal staircasing.
- **Daily Practice:** Each method was practiced for 15 minutes daily, totaling one hour of bridging practice per day.

While straight and diagonal bridging saw marked improvements, staircasing techniques presented ongoing challenges [[speed_bridging_techniques_in_minecraft | in mastering these bridging techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Aim Training

Using software like Aim Beast, the training regimen focused on improving in-game maneuverability:

- **Calibration:** The aim training software was adjusted to match Minecraft's sensitivity settings.
- **Exercises:** The regimen included tracking, target switching, flicking, and reaction time exercises.
- **Result:** The player reported significant improvements in control and precision over the week [[using_aim_training_software_to_enhance_minecraft_skills | with aim training software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## End-Game Practice on Hypixel

Putting all skills together, the player practiced on Hypixel's classic duels:

- **Bow and Fishing Rod Use:** These tools were integrated into combat scenarios.
- **Overall Improvement:** The player noticed steady improvement in wins and proficiency over the week [[technoblade_vs_dream__minecraft_pvp_skills | akin to the techniques used by famous PvP players]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
