From: [[beerbiceps]] <br/> 

Captain Raghu Raman is described by a common friend, Manish Pand, as one of the most unique individuals due to his exceptionally unique career path, encompassing military service, government work, and a corporate career, before transitioning into a role as a freelance motivation spreader and leadership coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. He views his life story not as extraordinary, but as a series of events that simply "happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Motivation to Join the Army

Born and raised in Delhi, despite his parents being from South India, Raghu Raman's original name is Ragu Raman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. His Delhi upbringing led people to mistake him for a Jat, and upon joining his Battalion, "Ragu Raman" became "Raman" and remained so throughout his army career, a common occurrence where individuals get "re-christened" in the Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

He studied at Delhi University, South Campus, with no initial intention of joining the Army, as no one in his family had military background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. His decision was influenced by the 1984 Delhi riots, which completely shook him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Witnessing the carnage in areas like Mayur Vihar and Trilokpuri (which was mentioned by the BBC as worst-hit), he observed the immediate calm that descended when the Army arrived after three days of mayhem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This experience, at 18-20 years old, made him realize, "This is the organization I want to join" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. He joined the Army in 1986, after applying in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Army Training and Selection Process

Army training is intensely focused on preparing leaders for active combat, emphasizing operating under high-stress conditions where one's life is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Looking back as an instructor, he understood the pedagogy behind elements like daily physical training and drill, which aim to create a synchronized unit that moves "at the speed of sound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

The selection process for the Army involves three stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>:
1.  **Common Entrance Exam**: An objective-type aptitude test, which he believes is much tougher now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.
2.  **Services Selection Board (SSB) Interview**: A 3-day (sometimes more) process testing for "officer-like quality" or leadership qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. This includes psychometric testing to assess if candidates can manage a team and perform under pressure without negative thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. The Army's HR process is unique, as after the SSB, all applicants are gathered, and the board president reads out names of those rejected, offering encouragement by stating a "better future" awaits them and citing examples of successful officers who cleared on multiple attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. He believes the SSB process accurately identifies leadership qualities needed for military operations, which differ from those in other spheres due to the critical need for physical courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.
3.  **Medical Examination**: The final stage to ensure physical fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

### Commando Course

After initial training, officers undergo specialized courses depending on their chosen arm (e.g., Mechanized Infantry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. Captain Raman underwent the Commando course, a "35 days and 35 nights of pure hell," which he did "many years ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. This course, held in Belgaum, focuses not just on physical fitness but primarily on mental training – the ability to function under immense mental stress, fear, trauma, and exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>.

Key aspects of the Commando course include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>:
*   Advanced physical fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.
*   Operating in small teams and working with improvisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.
*   Weapons training, including enemy weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.
*   Demolitions and explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.
*   Escape and Evasion (E&E): A simulated exercise where buddy pairs are dropped 90 km away in "enemy territory" and must navigate back to the academy without using roads, often pursued by troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. Getting caught means being returned to the starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.
*   Skills like reading maps without a compass and silent movement/killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.

## Army Career and Postings

Captain Raman's career spanned from 1987 to 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>. His first operational tenure was in Punjab (Sangrur) in 1987, where terrorism was still prevalent, and he gained early experience in minor skirmishes and cleanups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a>.

### Siachen Glacier

His second operational tenure was in Siachen, known as the highest and coldest battlefield in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:49:00">[36:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>. The area of contention stems from differing interpretations of the Line of Control drawn in 1971, specifically beyond Point NJ 9842 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:39:00">[37:39:00]</a>. Altitudes range from 18,000 to 22,000 feet, with temperatures dropping to -40 to -45 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>. Soldiers exist mostly on canned food and face extremely low oxygen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>.

Training for such environments includes area familiarization, mountaineering, rescue, climbing, and patrolling skills, alongside mental toughening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:00">[41:07:00]</a>. He notes that the unpredictability and fragility of life, where hypothermia, pulmonary edema, or lack of oxygen are constant threats, make it traumatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:03:00">[41:03:00]</a>.

### UN Peacekeeping Mission in Angola

His third operational tenure was as part of a UN peacekeeping contingent in Angola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59:00">[01:00:59:00]</a>. India is one of the largest and most respected contributors of troops to UN missions globally, recognized for its combat experience across diverse terrains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04:00">[01:01:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50:00">[01:01:50:00]</a>.

In Angola, Captain Raman served with the UN Blue Helmets, actual combat troops sent to enforce peace agreements between ruling governments and rebels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37:00">[01:16:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02:00">[01:17:02:00]</a>. Unlike direct combat, this role primarily involved exercising restraint, which he found "more nerve-wracking than actually being in combat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43:00">[01:14:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20:00">[01:15:20:00]</a>. The experience in Angola, where freedom was achieved and problems were continually solved through violence, made him deeply appreciate [[The Life of Krishna|Mahatma Gandhi]]'s contribution to India's non-violent protest culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17:00">[01:17:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01:00">[01:19:01:00]</a>.

### Later Postings and Transition

After Angola, he had a tenure in Suratgarh, a border area in Rajasthan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21:00">[01:19:21:00]</a>. His final posting in the Army was as an instructor at the Armored Corps Center and School in Ahmednagar, where he trained young officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:28:00">[01:29:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26:00">[01:19:26:00]</a>. His unit, the 22nd Mechanized Infantry Regiment, was one of the first to receive the new BMP-2 infantry combat vehicle, which came with Russian controls and manuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:45:00">[01:31:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:24:00">[01:32:24:00]</a>. He observed how 10th-grade jawans (soldiers) figured out how to operate complex equipment like infrared night vision devices, highlighting the innate human ability to learn sophisticated machinery quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:24:00">[01:32:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

After his Army service, Captain Raman transitioned to working with the government, then entered a corporate career with Reliance, and is now a freelance motivator and leadership coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. He also served as CEO of Automart India (now First Choice) and headed Mahindra Special Services Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40:00">[01:08:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. He left his corporate role at Reliance at age 54, prioritizing the ability to enjoy his time over further wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52:00">[01:38:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:41:00">[01:39:41:00]</a>.

## Life Lessons and Philosophy from the Army

### Brotherhood and Shared Trauma
The Army fosters incredibly strong, lifelong friendships due to shared traumatic experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. He likens this to how people remember traumatic events vividly, as opposed to mundane days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This bond means coursemates can reconnect after decades as if no time has passed, and officers often serve as "local guardians" for children of fellow officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. He considers this brotherhood the "real wealth" of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

### Perspective on Life and Death
He emphasizes that only those who have died in combat are true heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The greatest fear in battle is not personal injury or death, but the apprehension of whether one will be able to perform their duty and hold the responsibility of leading troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This "burden of command" – facing the families of fallen soldiers – weighs heavily on leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. He highlights that in the Army, mistakes are permanent, coming home in "body bags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

Experiencing near-death situations, like a car crash or a military operation, changes one's perspective on life, instilling gratitude and re-evaluation of priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. He advises contemplating the fragility of life and comparing one's situation to the less privileged to foster happiness and gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

### Spirituality in the Army
Spirituality plays a crucial role in the Army, especially in fearful situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Soldiers often become more religious when deployed to challenging areas like glaciers, where life is constantly at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Every army battalion has a spiritual teacher (e.g., Pandit, Granthi, Chaplain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Before any combat operation, pujas and blessings are common, reflecting a reliance on a higher force for solace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

### Family Life in the Army
Army life involves substantial time away from immediate family, but officers are part of a larger unit family, ensuring their families are looked after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59:00">[00:59:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12:00">[01:00:12:00]</a>. A strong "regimental spirit" means one phone call can ensure support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37:00">[01:00:37:00]</a>.

## Indian Army: Culture, Capabilities, and Future

### Global Perception and Combat Experience
The Indian Army is highly respected globally for being one of the most combat-experienced armies, having fought in diverse terrains like glaciers, mountains, jungles, and deserts since Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23:00">[01:01:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50:00">[01:01:50:00]</a>. This "battle hardening" is crucial in combat, as training cannot fully replicate real-world scenarios where "targets shoot back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11:00">[01:02:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48:00">[01:02:48:00]</a>.

### Respect for the Enemy
Captain Raman stresses that professional soldiers do not hold personal enmity against their enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. Disrespecting an enemy is "fundamentally stupid" as it leads to mistakes and overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. He cites the Kargil War, where the Indian Army wrote gallantry award citations for Pakistani officers, acknowledging their creditable fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.

### Internal Diversity and Unity
The Indian Army, despite having a multitude of regiments with different cultures, food habits, and ways of operating (e.g., Gurkha, Sikh, Madras battalions), maintains a common operational vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35:00">[01:03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08:00">[01:05:08:00]</a>. This allows for diverse cultures to flourish while ensuring unified command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52:00">[01:05:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01:00">[01:06:01:00]</a>. Different troops are known for specific traits, like the Gurkhas for stoicism in rear-guard battles or Sikh units for their "exploitative nature" (positive sense of adventure and readiness to try new things) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38:00">[01:11:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35:00">[01:12:35:00]</a>. Indian soldiers are highly regarded for their professionalism and intelligence, often reverse-engineering and modifying equipment beyond manufacturer specifications due to the necessity of improvisation in life-or-death situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01:00">[01:13:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40:00">[01:13:40:00]</a>.

### Future of the Indian Army and Advice for Youth
Captain Raman notes that every technology used today originated from war (e.g., laser, internet, AI, drones, jet engines) because nations invest heavily when fighting for existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42:00">[01:20:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22:00">[01:21:22:00]</a>. While the Indian Army remains manpower-intensive due to its diverse and long borders, technology like AI is increasingly vital in areas like intelligence, big data, and especially logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39:00">[01:21:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01:00">[01:22:01:00]</a>. He emphasizes that wars are fought on logistics, a complex system managing unique characteristics of every vehicle and supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29:00">[01:22:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

He offers several reasons why young people should join the Indian Army today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>:
*   **Learning from the "Primary Fountain Head"**: Many management lessons, like span of command or hierarchical structures, originated from military practices (e.g., Subedar, Havildar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Camaraderie and Wealth of Relationships**: The intense bonding creates lifelong friendships and a valuable support network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16:00">[01:26:16:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Development and Exposure**: The Army provides unparalleled experiences, including diverse travel, exposure to different cultures, and opportunities for activities like horse riding, swimming, polo, shooting, and flying gliders, which even millionaires might not afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28:00">[01:27:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:12:00">[01:28:12:00]</a>. It equips individuals to handle life's challenges by fostering accelerated learning, entrepreneurship, and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41:00">[01:26:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03:00">[01:29:03:00]</a>.
*   **Education and Skills**: The Army offers high-quality training and opportunities for soldiers to become engineers, pilots, and missile pilots, providing valuable life skills beyond their military tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16:00">[01:29:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31:00">[01:31:31:00]</a>.

Captain Raman believes the "Army brand" needs to be better built, moving beyond its machismo image to highlight its role in aid to civil authorities and the immense talent pool of retired, highly trained jawans entering civilian life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01:00">[01:42:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06:00">[01:44:06:00]</a>. He stresses the increasing importance for average Indians to understand national security, as modern conflicts directly impact civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:10:00">[01:45:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:09:00">[01:46:09:00]</a>.
