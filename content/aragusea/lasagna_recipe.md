This lasagna recipe is a substantial undertaking, spread across three days, and is typically made for special occasions in large quantities due to the labor involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Day 1: Bolognese Sauce

The first day is dedicated to making a non-traditional [[making_bolognese_sauce | bolognese sauce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Ingredients
*   1 lb carrots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   1 large red onion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   1 lb chicken livers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   3 lbs ground meat (any kind) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Small can of tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   Whole bottle of white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   3 large cans of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   1 large spoonful of liquid chicken bouillon (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   Dried herbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Balsamic vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Salt (to taste) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

### Method
1.  Process carrots and red onion in a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  Fry the processed vegetables in a large Dutch oven, then remove them from the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  Add 3 pounds of ground meat to the Dutch oven and cook on high heat, stirring aggressively with a wooden spoon to break it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  After 15-20 minutes, the water will boil off, allowing the meat to fry in its own fat until it browns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
5.  Add the chicken livers and a small can of tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
6.  Once the bottom of the pan is about to burn, pour in a whole bottle of white wine and scrape the bottom clean to deglaze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
7.  Return the fried vegetables to the pot, then add three large cans of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
8.  Optionally, add a large spoonful of liquid chicken bouillon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
9.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for three hours, stirring occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
10. During the last hour, add dried herbs, pepper, and a bunch of balsamic vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The recipe is acidic, which brightens the flavors in the lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
11. After three hours, taste and adjust seasoning with salt, more vinegar, or anything else it needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
12. This yields about twice the amount needed for the lasagna; the rest can be frozen later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Let the pot cool down and store the entire batch in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Day 2: Pasta and Cheese Sauce

The second day involves preparing the fresh pasta dough and the cheese sauce.

### Spinach Preparation
1.  Boil about 8 ounces of spinach (one bag or half a bin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  Cover it to steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
3.  Prepare a bowl of ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
4.  Stir the spinach, and once it's wilted (about 2 minutes), pull it out into the ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Shocking the spinach in ice water sets its green color and prevents it from browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
5.  Squeeze as much water out of the spinach as possible before using it for the green dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Fresh Pasta Dough

Two types of fresh pasta dough are made: yellow (egg) and green (spinach). A food processor makes the process easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

#### Yellow Dough
*   4 eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   1 teaspoon salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   2 cups flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
1.  Combine eggs, salt, and flour in a food processor and whiz until it forms one giant ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This eggier pasta stays firm after baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  Dump the dough onto plastic wrap; stickiness doesn't matter as flour content will be adjusted during rolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

#### Green Dough
*   Squeezed spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   3 eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> (spinach counts as one egg's moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>)
*   1 teaspoon salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   2 cups flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
1.  Put squeezed spinach and 3 eggs in the food processor and whiz to cut up the spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
2.  Add salt and 2 cups of flour, then whiz until it comes together into one big ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
3.  Wrap both doughs and refrigerate for at least half an hour to hydrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Cheese Sauce (Béchamel)
1.  Melt a stick of butter in a large pan over medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  Chop a whole head of garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Whisk in enough flour (no more than a cup) to make a thick paste, creating a roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
4.  Add the garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
5.  Gradually whisk in half a gallon of milk, adding a little at a time to prevent sloshing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
6.  Once all the milk is in, pull the pan off the heat and let it cool until it stops bubbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
7.  Grate a whole 7-ounce block of pecorino cheese into the cooled sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Using parmesan is an option, but sheep's milk cheese's acidity cuts better through the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Grating cheese off the boil prevents it from going grainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
8.  Whisk the cheese in; it doesn't need to be totally smooth as it will melt in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
9.  Taste and add more salt deliberately, making the sauce the primary source of salt for the entire lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Rolling and Cooking Pasta
1.  Fill the largest pot with salted water and bring to a boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
2.  Use a standard 6-inch wide pasta roller, secured to the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
3.  Dust a dough ball (start with half for easier handling) with flour and smoosh into a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
4.  Run through the thickest setting, then fold, dust, and run through multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This kneads the dough and adjusts flour content; add more flour if it doesn't roll smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
5.  To shape, gradually reduce the thickness setting, sending the dough through each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. For lasagna, roll to the second-to-last setting; if it's too thin, it will go mushy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
6.  Cut pasta to the length of your baking pan (e.g., 17 inches for an 11x19 inch pan, accounting for expansion during boiling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Kitchen scissors are easy to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Cut each sheet into two ribbons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
7.  Prepare a giant bowl of ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
8.  Quickly lay pasta ribbons into the boiling water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. They are done when they puff up and float aggressively to the top (about 2 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
9.  Transfer immediately to the cold water to stop cooking and prevent gumminess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
10. Lay out kitchen towels. Pull out one noodle at a time, swipe off excess water, and lay side-by-side on towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Use another towel to dry the top-facing sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. They don't need to be bone-dry, but soaking wet pasta will dissolve and make the lasagna runny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
11. Repeat the process for the remaining yellow and green dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Lasagna Layering and First Bake

### [[layering_and_baking_lasagna | Layering and Baking Lasagna]]
1.  Lay down a sheet pan to support the flimsy foil pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
2.  Oil the foil pan to prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
3.  Lay in the first layer of pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Broken noodles don't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
4.  Add a layer of either bolognese or cheese sauce. It helps if the cheese sauce is warm to smooth out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
5.  Alternate layers of green pasta, yellow pasta, bolognese, and cheese sauce. Ensure the bolognese is at room temperature to spread thinly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
6.  Build as many alternating layers as you have pasta and sauce. Seven layers were achieved in the example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
7.  On the very top layer, dab streaks of both bolognese and cheese sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
8.  Bake in a 400°F (200°C) oven for 20 minutes for the first bake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
9.  Let it cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
10. If desired, leftover pasta scraps can be fried with butter, cheese, and red pepper flakes for a snack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
11. Refrigerate the lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Day 3: Reheating and Serving

The third day is the easiest, ideal for dinner parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### Quick Tomato Sauce
*   Garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
*   Shallots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>
*   Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   Tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
*   Two 28-ounce cans of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>
*   Splash of white wine (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
*   Seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
1.  Fry chopped garlic and shallots in oil with a squeeze of tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
2.  Add two 28-ounce cans of crushed tomatoes and an optional splash of white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
3.  Season and simmer for half an hour, stirring frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Final Bake and Serving
1.  Roughly grate a pound of mozzarella or preferred cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
2.  Cut the chilled lasagna into 12 pieces (large portions), or 15-18 pieces if serving with other dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Cutting it cold results in a nice, clean cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
3.  Oil a baking sheet (do not use foil, as lasagna will stick) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
4.  Lift out individual pieces with a spatula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
5.  Cover the top of each piece with grated mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
6.  Bake in a 400°F (200°C) oven, using the convection setting if available for browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
7.  Spread pieces out on two or three sheet pans to allow hot air to circulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
8.  Bake for 20 minutes to heat through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. If cheese isn't browning enough, use the broiler at the very end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
9.  Taste the red sauce and adjust seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
10. Serve with a thin layer of tomato sauce on the plate, floating the lasagna on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
11. Garnish with fresh basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

This two-stage baking method results in every piece being an "edge piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, and baked pasta dishes are generally better on the second day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The tomato sauce on the bottom ties the whole thing together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
