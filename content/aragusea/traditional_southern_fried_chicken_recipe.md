This recipe aims to make traditional Southern pan-fried chicken as easily as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The most challenging aspect for beginners might be [[how_to_cut_up_a_whole_chicken_for_frying | cutting up a whole raw chicken]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Choosing and Cutting the Chicken

A small chicken, ideally three to three and a quarter pounds, is perfect for fried chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Pre-cut chicken pieces often come from larger, older birds (four or five pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The upper maximum for frying is about a three and a half pound bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

To cut up a whole chicken into at least eight pieces:
1.  **Remove the Backbone**: Use kitchen shears to snip up both sides of the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This can be frozen for stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
2.  **Spatchcock**: Flip the bird over. The chicken is now "spatchcocked," which is good for roasting whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
3.  **Separate Breasts**: Use a sharp chef's knife to cut between the two breasts, right through the breastbone, applying force as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This creates two half chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
4.  **Separate Leg Quarters**: Pull the leg out away from the breast and cut through the connecting skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Slice through the thin area of meat connecting the leg and breast quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, potentially crunching through a rib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
5.  **Separate Leg and Thigh**: Cut into the crook between the leg and the [[different_methods_for_cooking_chicken_thighs | thigh]] until hitting bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Hyperextend the joint to dislocate it, then cut through the remaining meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. If the joint doesn't pop, it should open enough to see the sinew to cut through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
6.  **Separate Wing and Breast**: With the breast and wing attached, cut straight down through the bone about two-thirds of the way up from the thin point of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This results in eight pieces of relatively similar size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This amount is typically enough for four people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## [[buttermilk_and_seasoning_techniques_for_fried_chicken | Buttermilk and Seasoning Techniques for Fried Chicken]]

### Seasoning
Aggressively season the chicken pieces with:
*   Lots of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   Lots of pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
*   Onion powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   Garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   Cayenne pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

Apply seasoning to both sides of the chicken, and mop up any leftover seasoning on the board with the sides of the pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Dried sage and thyme can be added for an herbal note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Brining
While some dry cure the chicken in seasoning for a few hours for a crispy skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, a Southern style prefers brining in buttermilk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
Instead of mixing seasoning into buttermilk and submerging the chicken (which requires calculating salinity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, season the meat directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
Place all chicken pieces into a Ziploc bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Pour in just enough buttermilk (around half a cup) to coat the pieces in a thick paste of seasoning and buttermilk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This method yields the same flavor while wasting less seasoning and buttermilk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
For convenience, buttermilk can be approximated by adding a splash of vinegar to regular milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
Brine the chicken in the fridge for a full 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, though less time can also work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Breading

1.  **Warm-up**: The next day, remove the chicken from the fridge to allow it to warm up, which helps it cook evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
2.  **Flour Mixture**: In a large Tupperware, combine:
    *   2 cups of flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
    *   1 teaspoon of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
    *   A heaped teaspoon of baking powder (this makes the crust light and crispy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
    *   A generous amount of ground pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
    *   A little more cayenne pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
    *   *Do not* add garlic or onion powder to the flour, as they burn easily and should be protected underneath the outermost crust layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
3.  **First Coat**: Scrape off excess buttermilk from each chicken piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Place four pieces at a time into the Tupperware with the flour mixture, put on the lid, and shake to coat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Place the coated pieces on a rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
4.  **Egg Sludge**: Crack an egg into the Ziploc bag containing the remaining buttermilk seasoning paste and beat it with your fingers to combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Put all the chicken pieces back into this bag to get another dose of seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
5.  **Second Coat**: As each piece comes out, ensure it has an even, thin coating of the egg sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Shake them up again in the flour, four pieces at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
6.  **Resting**: Let the breaded chicken pieces sit on the rack for a good half-hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This allows the flour particles to hydrate in the egg and buttermilk, helping the crust adhere better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Frying

### Setup
*   Use two 10-inch skillets simultaneously if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> to ensure even heating across all pieces, especially for ranges with uneven heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This also allows for independent control over white meat and dark meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   A rack for draining the cooked chicken is also needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   A meat thermometer is very helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   Use a neutral oil like vegetable or peanut oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Start with a half-inch of oil, as the chicken will displace it and raise the level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. More oil can be added if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### [[frying_temperature_and_oil_usage_for_optimal_chicken_frying | Frying Temperature and Oil Usage for Optimal Chicken Frying]]
1.  **Initial Heat**: Set burners to medium heat and wait a few minutes until the oil starts swirling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
2.  **Placement**: Lay the chicken pieces skin-side down first, as this side will look nicer in the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
3.  **Frying Temperature**: The ideal frying temperature is not a roaring boil or a sizzle, but a "fizzle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This typically means turning burners down to virtually their lowest setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The ideal oil temperature for this fizzle is about 250°F (121°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   **Rationale**: Large, bone-in chicken pieces need a long time to cook through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Frying at 350°F (177°C) would cause the crust to burn before the meat is cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. A "blonde going on gold" crust is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. If the crust is pale when the meat is almost done, the heat can be increased at the end to crisp it quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
4.  **Flipping**: Flip the chicken after 15 minutes, once the crust on the underside has fully formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Maintain the oil level at halfway up the sides of the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. If a piece bunches up and becomes too tall, stand it on its end to get more oil contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
5.  **Checking Doneness**:
    *   **Temperature**: Start checking the internal temperature after about 30 minutes of cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Aim for 160-165°F (71-74°C) in the white meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Take multiple measurements to avoid misreadings from oil pockets or bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   **Juice Clarity**: The traditional method is to pierce the meat and check the juice color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>; it should be clear, not red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
6.  **Finishing**: As the chicken approaches doneness, the oil can be allowed to get hotter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Flip the pieces again after another 15 minutes to ensure all sides are crunchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Once the white meat reaches 160-165°F (71-74°C), remove the chicken to the rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Serving and Cleanup

*   Let the chicken cool for a good 10 minutes on the rack before eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   Total cooking time is typically around 35 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Frying a bigger bird would take much longer and cook less evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   Regarding the test of real buttermilk vs. milk with vinegar: real buttermilk tastes slightly better, but the difference is subtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Oil Disposal**: Do not pour used fry oil down the drain, as it can damage pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Filtered oil can be reused, but burying it in a vegetable garden is also an option, as it acts as fertilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
