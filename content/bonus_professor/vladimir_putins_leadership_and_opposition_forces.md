## Political Situation and Protests
A discussion on [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia's political situation and leadership]] focused on the dynamics over the last month and a half to two months, particularly concerning the return of [[Alexei Navalny | Alexei Navalny]] and subsequent protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Navalny's Return and Impact
[[Alexei Navalny | Alexei Navalny]]'s act of returning to [[russia | Russia]] was undoubtedly heroic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, the anticipated immediate dynamics following his return did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. After his return, a film about [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin's palace]] was released and watched by over 110 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Despite this, only about 100,000 people (approximately 1.1% of viewers) participated in the protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This low turnout raised doubts about the effectiveness of the act in sparking widespread revolutionary movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. [[Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] is considered the leader of the [[conflict_within_the_russian_opposition_and_its_implications | Russian opposition]] and a powerful force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Deficiencies in Protest Organization
A key missing element in the protests was organization, both of the protest itself and the movement of rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Protesters often lacked specific, clear goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> and used rather dubious slogans, such as "for the release of [[Alexei Navalny | Navalny]]", which not everyone was ready to support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The act of [[Alexei Navalny | Navalny]]'s self-sacrifice was not sufficiently appreciated by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. There were organizational errors and poor communication between protesters and organizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. People went out aimlessly, without clear prospects for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. It was suggested that with 30,000 people on the streets of Moscow, an organized and coordinated effort could have led to a radically different outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

The decision by the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) to refuse active protests was attributed to a combination of their own flaws and the unpreparedness of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Society was considered ready for [[Alexei Navalny | Navalny]]'s return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, but the viewing of exposés on [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin's palace]] by 110 million people only translated to 100,000 protesters on the streets (one-tenth of a percent), which is a "statistical error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Authorities' Mistakes and Future Triggers
The authorities are making all possible mistakes that will prevent them from seeing the impending changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The upcoming Duma elections are expected to be rigged, serving as another serious trigger for protest movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Before the Duma elections, there will likely be enough triggers to stir up the protest movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Any revolution fundamentally relies on a split within the elites, which is necessary for significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Kremlin's Reaction and Putin's Fears
The posts from the General SVR Telegram channel are read by the entire [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | Russian leadership]] and most high-ranking officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | President Putin]] is aware of the risks and will try to hold onto power by all means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. However, it is believed there will be an opportunity to imprison him within a year, even during his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. He is described as a "rat driven into a corner" who will resist, albeit an "old, sick rat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. While not a complete idiot, he understands the rules by which he plays within [[russia | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. It is impossible to win by playing by his rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>; instead, the strategy is to manipulate him and press his "calluses" to make him commit certain actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] is a very suspicious person with many phobias, particularly afraid of being manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This fear is skillfully exploited by those around him and by the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Rumors of a conspiracy against [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] led by Patrushev are denied, but it's suggested that if [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] believes it exists, he should remain wary of Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. [[Vladimir Putins health and political future | Putin's health]] is a serious factor affecting his decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The announcement of his health status significantly affects many processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The management of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, FSB, and armed forces also consider [[Vladimir Putins health and political future | Putin's health]], understanding that guarantees from a sick, dying person are worth nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

Early presidential elections are being planned by internal forces, but [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] is maniacally afraid of his plans becoming known, causing them to be cancelled or postponed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. The aim is to interfere with his plans, which is considered a significant achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Many things are said precisely to prevent his plans from succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Early presidential elections, initially planned for April of this year, have been postponed and are not currently discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Even the president's message to the Federal Assembly has been indefinitely postponed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This indicates that [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] is adapting to the opposition's tune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

[[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] has become very withdrawn and trusts almost no one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Parliamentary elections are also not planned to be held ahead of schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Recent rumors in Moscow suggested they might be postponed until early summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

### Putin's Inner Circle and Trust
[[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] primarily trusts Nikolai Patrushev and Yuri Kovalchuk, who hold the most influence over him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Others, like Igor Sechin, have less influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] has never taken Sechin seriously enough to rely on his constant opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Sechin is seen as an intriguer whom [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] uses when convenient and distances himself from when not interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Sergey Kiriyenko is influential because he carries out tasks and takes responsibility, which [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] likes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Kiriyenko was in good standing after organizing the plebiscite on the constitution but later fell out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

### Putin's View of Enemies and Foreign Leaders
[[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] views [[Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] as a personal enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. He does not consider him a traitor but hates those who betrayed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] kills not only enemies but also people he has never met, based on recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

Regarding foreign politicians, [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] respects any US president due to their position and genuinely fears the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. He is afraid to oppose US interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. During his reign, classic espionage on US territory was minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. He transitioned from dreaming of hot wars to understanding the effectiveness of hybrid warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. He uses hybrid warfare methods, including cyberattacks on the US, France, and constantly on Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

[[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] also respects the Chinese leader due to his position and the significant economic and political leverage [[china | China]] has over [[russia | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] fulfills the whims and desires of the Chinese leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. He also respects Angela Merkel and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. Erdoğan is seen as his "alter ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] helped Erdoğan avoid a military coup by informing him through intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. While [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] doesn't particularly like Merkel, he respects her and is forced to reckon with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

### Future Revelations and Goals
The Telegram channel "General SVR" has become one of the most popular in [[russia | Russia]], ranking fifth in January and 82nd globally in terms of reach per post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. The channel's information excites those against whom their activities are directed, leading to numerous attacks and attempts to discredit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. The channel asserts that its ability to reach the top of most-read channels in four and a half months, filled with exclusive content, proves real access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

The channel warned Valery Soloviev in July about a planned assassination attempt against him and other opposition figures, including Mark Feigin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. They also predicted [[Alexei Navalny | Navalny]]'s poisoning by Novichok and advised how to avoid it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. The channel was the first to describe [[Alexei Navalny | Navalny]]'s assassination attempt, long before investigations by Bellingcat and The Insider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. Their description aligned with later reports from The New York Times, citing German special services, and did not contradict Bellingcat's findings, only adding detail about the poison's application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. This information, along with details about [[vladimir_putins_health and political future | President Putin]]'s health, requires access to decision-making circles in the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.

The channel's goal is to influence [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] by making him fear manipulation, thereby disrupting his plans and intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. They do not conduct investigations but expose crimes they know firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. Future plans include releasing more incriminating materials related to various terrorist acts and deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. They praise investigations by "Base" into Magnitogorsk and Bellingcat/The Insider, and "The Project" for their sensitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. They aim to release "sharp things" at the opportune moment for maximum impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. They will also address the involvement of oligarchs, such as Usmanov and Deripaska, in the Kremlin's dirty political affairs, especially after [[Alexei Navalny | Navalny]]'s call for sanctions against those supporting the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. They plan to reveal information about the crash of the Polish plane where the Polish president died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. The ultimate goal is to change the [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | system]] and remove criminals from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

### Relationship with Lukashenko
[[Alexei Navalny | Lukashenko]] can manipulate [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] at will, with [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] almost begging him for concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>. Lukashenko will undoubtedly receive a loan of 3 billion dollars from [[russia | Russia]], with [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] showing disregard for the Russian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. Their relationship is emotionally connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>. The brutality of the suppression of protests in Belarus is far worse than in [[russia | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>.

### Reforming Russian Special Services
Reforming [[russia | Russia]]'s special services is possible, as demonstrated by [[Georgia | Georgia]]'s reforms under Mikheil Saakashvili, which eliminated corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. A key reform should be a complete lustration of the entire judicial corps, followed by recruitment of professional lawyers and researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. An honest and decent court will pave the way for further reforms of the special services, which can be achieved in historically short terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

[[russia | Russian]] special services are considered professional, and if their criminal component (murders, special operations, hybrid warfare) is removed, they can be redirected to eliminate real external and internal threats, not fight the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>. Failures like the Skripal and [[Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] poisonings reflect the degradation of specific groups, not the entire special services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
