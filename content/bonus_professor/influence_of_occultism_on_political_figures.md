Andrey Kosmach, a philosopher and leading specialist in [[occultism and magical practices in Russia | occultism and magical practices]] in Russia, is recognized internationally for his expertise in this field of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He provides insights into how these practices intersect with political figures and power dynamics, particularly within the Russian establishment.

## The Bon Ritual Against Vladimir Putin

In June 2020, a specific ritual was performed, targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This ritual was based on the Bon religion, considered one of the world's most complex and mysterious faiths with origins in prehistory, lacking written records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

There are two main versions of Bon:
*   **"Old" Bon**: Practiced in Nepal, Tibet, and Western Mongolia, focusing on an indivisible and eternal fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **"New" Bon**: Adapted to Buddhism, having nothing in common with the eternal aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Modern manifestations, such as those in Nepal, are often picturesque, eclectic performances with elements of Gallic dance and animal sacrifice, conducted by Buddhist monks, which do not represent authentic ancient practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Bon has faced severe persecution for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Twentieth-century pseudo-studies, aiming to portray Bon as bloody and cruel, were often based on Buddhist sources or author's imagination (e.g., Nikolai Roerich), without any direct contact with Bon priests or authentic texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Such studies incorrectly linked Bon to Satanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The true essence of the Bon religion is shrouded in multi-stage veils of secrecy, existing beyond the rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Its temple complexes are found in hard-to-reach, natural labyrinthine caves in the Nepalese Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Andrey Kosmach claims to be one of the few Russians who has witnessed authentic Bon rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. He states that these practices are capable of changing the algorithm of fate and teaching individuals to control events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The fundamental practice of Bon is achieving a state of non-duality, a harmony between feeling and reason, which is necessary before ascending the ladder of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This knowledge is kept secret because modern individuals are often unable to understand these practices harmoniously and might misuse the knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

### The Egregor Ritual and its Impact
On June 21, 2020, during a solar eclipse, a ritual to create an "egregor" was performed in Corrigan Taxcom, Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. An egregor is a non-material, complex energy substance that can alter the trajectory of fate, in this case, the fate of an individual connected to the destiny of the entire post-Soviet space – namely, the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The core of an egregor is an idea, which determines its influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Crucial periods for egregor formation are its central part and its culmination (50th day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   The formation of the central part coincided with the protests in Khabarovsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   The period of maximum strength coincided with the Belarusian elections on August 9, 2020, which led to large-scale protests, effectively canceling the Kremlin's desired unification project between Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

From that moment, "the luck factor pulled the leader forever," and fortune turned its back on Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. While metaphysical practices can create fluctuations, real change requires the free will of people and their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

The Federal Security Service (FSB) investigated this information, confirming its relevance. Specialists from the Kremlin traveled to China and then to Balkhash, where lamas corroborated the ritual's performance and confirmed its irreversible final effect, as the key details of the Bon practice are carefully guarded and unknown to Buddhists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

## Shamanism and the Russian Elite

Russian President Vladimir Putin is known to consult with shamans during his visits to regions like Siberia, often accompanied by Sergey Shoigu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

### Authentic Shamanism vs. Modern Vulgarization
Shamanism is based on a dualistic worldview, dividing the world into everyday and sacred realms, with a mystical worldview at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. While shamans across continents share common features, their distinctive traits, especially regarding initiation rites, dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

In Russia, the algorithm for shamanic initiation rites has been largely lost due to ruthless persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Most algorithms and rituals that survive do so thanks to historians who collected ethnographic materials, many of which were lost during the Soviet period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

The traditional shamanic initiation involves:
*   A hereditary "shamanic gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   Chosenness by spirits, mentally encouraging the difficult path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   Manifestation of a "shamanic disease" in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.
*   7-12 years of study and conceptual learning under an experienced shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   A clan council recognizing the initiate's right to be a shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   A multi-day ritual opened by a shaman mentor, involving the instillation of a specific spirit, purification (ablution, smoke), and consumption of an elixir (hallucinogenic mushrooms or tracks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   Slaughter of a sacrificial animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.
*   Presentation of shamanic attributes: crown with horns, staff, whip, tambourine, ritual costume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   Independent shamanizing, calling on spirits and deities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   Culmination: vision of ancestral spirits and introduction of a specific number of spirits into the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
*   Completion: determined by the vision of the original spirit that opened the ceremony, followed by ablution and blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

Modern shamanism in Russia suffers from vulgarization and simplification, absorbing local features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. Knowledge about shamanism in Russia is fragmented, leading to more versions and hypotheses than definitive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

### Historical and Sociopolitical Context
One historical version suggests that harsh repressive measures against shamanic communities in young Soviet Russia stemmed from Joseph Stalin's involvement in a clan council dispute in Turukhansk in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. Stalin, then exiled, sided with an Evenki prince against a shaman, after which the shaman experienced an "unpleasant incident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

Paradoxically, Russia is described as a unique state where the government, despite persecuting figures like shaman Alexander Gabyshev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, itself believes in and consults shamans, even on matters like pension reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. They view shamans as protectors who can safeguard their regime from external influences and the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

However, the speaker notes that it is often impossible to confirm if these self-proclaimed shamans have undergone genuine initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. The tradition is largely lost, meaning most "shamans" encountered are imposters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. The authorities are satisfied with engaging with these pseudo-shamans because it provides a "placebo effect," calming them and offering a sense of legitimacy to their power claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. This phenomenon creates a trend where others in society also adopt "comic phantasmagoric" versions of shamanism, such as the widely publicized incident during the Efremov verdict announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.

## Black Magic and Grimoires in Modern Russia

There is a growing interest in [[historical and contemporary perspectives on black magic | black magic]] in modern Russia, particularly within the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. This interest often extends to texts called "grimoires" and collections of ceremonial magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

Andrey Kosmach asserts that so-called "black magicians" have no historical roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. He argues that the concept of [[historical and contemporary perspectives on black magic | black magic]] is a "creative creation" of the Holy Roman Inquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. Many known works attributed to black magic have no connection to metaphysics and are irrational, being "a figment of the imagination" of medieval inquisitor monks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. Historical manuscripts were deliberately destroyed or "scraped" (palimpsests), with new texts written over them to distort original meanings and demonize genuine [[occultism and magical practices in Russia | occultism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.

Grimoires currently in use, even those purchased at high prices by Russian buyers, are effectively "skillfully concocted fakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. Genuine grimoires, used by 13 great occult orders, are based on rare ancient rituals (e.g., Minoan tract, Medici family manuscripts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. These authentic grimoires do not mention devils or demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. In contrast, pseudo-grimoires, created by the Catholic Church, are filled with references to demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

The Russian pseudo-establishment has a particular affinity for rituals that are "oversaturated with dream fate and ceremonial theatricality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. They use an eclectic mix of pseudo-grimoires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. Other quasi-rituals popular in glamorous hotels, like those of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn or Enochian magic, are also based on falsified texts, such as a supposed treatise by Hermes Trismegistus, revealed to be a fake written by a monk named Leonardo under Cardinal Giovanni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

### Occultism vs. Faith and the Placebo Effect
True [[occultism and magical practices in Russia | occultism]] does not rely on faith; every ritual action must be experimentally confirmed and repeatable with the same result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. A study conducted by an occult order in the 1970s, which tested all known rituals, found that 97% were "empty spoons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.

The authentic grimoires are inaccessible to the modern establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Using these falsified or useless grimoires can actually lead to the opposite of the desired result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. A high-ranking Russian official's personal motive for visiting such places and conducting rituals was described as "Satanism for me as a tool justification of the present and the prospect of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. This highlights a desire for self-justification and a sense of control, even if based on false pretenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. This behavior is compared to attending party meetings during the CPSU era – a necessity for conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. This trend of engaging with occult practices in Europe has existed for centuries, while in Russia, it has emerged in the last two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

Even aristocratic families, politicians, bankers, and industrialists in Europe visit places like the "crystal sarcophagus" hall in the Parisian catacombs, dedicated to the demon Bael and officiated by a hermaphrodite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. They firmly believe these visits grant them special power, despite evidence suggesting otherwise, serving as a placebo effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

## Ayahuasca and Amazonian Shamans

Another trend among the Russian elite and middle class involves traveling to the Amazon in search of shamans and out-of-body journeys via "ayahuasca" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

Traditionally, ayahuasca is considered a divine gift, only to be used by those to whom it was intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. Revealing its secret to outsiders is believed to anger the gods, leading to disease and difficulties for the tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. However, the temptation of money leads many tribes to offer a "complex decoction" to wealthy pilgrims, which has a hallucinogenic effect akin to ayahuasca but is not the authentic substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.

Authentic ayahuasca consists of only two components (liana *Banisteriopsis caapi* and leaves of *Psychotria viridis*) and its preparation is a long, specific ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. The genuine method is used only in rare, special ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Other times, "variation" methods with over 30 components are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>. The crucial element is the ritual's sequence, not just the recipe or components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. This sequence involves three main stages:
1.  **Preparation**: Administering entheogens (plant-based psychoactive substances) *before* the main ceremony to reset consciousness and prepare for a full trance, ensuring a genuine hallucination by excluding a mixture of new experiences and old memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>.
2.  **Trance**: Only after clearing the "allegorical fog" is ayahuasca used, initiating a full transpersonal journey where boundaries of space and time disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.
3.  **Return**: After the transpersonal trip, another entheogen is given to allow the spirit to return to the body without getting lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

Rich pilgrims receive only a distant semblance of the ritual because they are considered "strangers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. The "ethnographic villages" where these rituals take place are often specially built for tourists, only coming to life on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. Pilgrims receive a "very high quality hallucinosis," created by their own brains, and return satisfied but without engaging in the authentic ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

Touring "shamans" who visit countries like Ukraine and Russia are largely charlatans, part of a commercial project by "civilized" Amazonian tribes to monetize rich "fools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. They fly anywhere and tell clients what they want to hear, through translators, making it a form of expensive psychotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. Such experiences cost upwards of half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

Some "advanced" members of the Russian pseudo-elite consider Amazonian shamanism "atavism," preferring substances like bufotenin from Colorado River toads, mixed with dimethyltryptamine, or traditional psilocybin mushrooms for their "transpersonal flights" to Nibiru or Sirius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.

## The Cup of the Blind King Ritual

The "Cup of the Blind King" is an authentic ritual from the collection of Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. Its key attributes are a golden cup and 33 text spells written on leather scrolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.

The ritual involves:
*   Filling a pure golden cup with "anthropomorphic blood" (human blood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>.
*   Placing the cup on a hot surface with an open fire underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.
*   Cutting the cup in half, causing its contents to spill onto the hot surface, leading to a violent reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.
*   Casting the "golden seal of death" from the two halves of the cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.
*   Burning the leather scrolls on the same surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.
*   Preserving the resulting ash to make the "seal of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

This ritual's implementation is associated with undermining mental stability, creating mental epidemics, and leading to induced disorder and identity destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

The basic ritual was performed on December 14, 2020, during a solar eclipse, in Rio Negro province, Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. Two related variation rituals were also performed in Nepal and the Mongolian yoke of the Biysky Altai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. The complexity of this ritual lies in its fundamental immutability, allowing some innovations that complicate it further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. Counter-rites are dangerous and would only strengthen the original ritual, similar to an antidote requiring precise knowledge of the poison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>.
