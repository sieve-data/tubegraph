Physicists face significant [[Challenges in quantum physics and gravity | challenges]] in reconciling [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] with gravity, particularly in developing a unified theory of [[Relativity and quantum gravity | quantum gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Traditional methods of applying [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] to gravitational interactions have led to impasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Problem of Unification
The primary goal of [[Relativity and quantum gravity | quantum gravity]] is to create a model that integrates both classical and [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Currently, Einstein's equations perfectly describe the universe on a macro scale, including galaxies and black holes, while [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum theory]] describes elementary particles on a microscopic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. There is no single theory that unifies these two descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

Attempts to build such a unified theory using the laws of quantization for gravity, starting from the 1920s and 1930s, have consistently failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Calculations repeatedly resulted in infinities, a problem physicists refer to as a "lack of renormalization," indicating that the approach of building a quantum theory of gravity like other theories is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. It seems necessary to return to fundamental principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### The Standard Approach vs. An Alternative
Most physicists believe that to achieve [[Unification of gravity and quantum mechanics | unification]], [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] should remain unchanged as established by figures like Dirac and Heisenberg, while the theory of gravity should be modified or considered valid only at low energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This approach has led to persistent problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

An alternative idea proposes keeping gravity at the level of Einstein's equations largely unchanged, and instead, reformulating [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] to address its paradoxes by incorporating gravitational effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This perspective suggests that [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] itself might need revision, especially concerning its non-locality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Twistor Theory
The [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]], nearly 50 years old and developed by Roger Penrose, was initially conceived to provide a mathematical formalism describing both [[Interplay between classical and quantum physics | classical and quantum physics]] in a similar way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This theory departs from the fundamental concept of points in space-time, which are considered the building blocks in most other models of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Instead, the [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] posits that a light ray is a more elementary object, and "twist space" is the space of all such rays with an additional degree of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. A point in space-time emerges only at a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

The [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] aims to reformulate most of [[Interplay between classical and quantum physics | classical and quantum physics]] using the language of these light rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While the physics derived from the [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] was initially unclear, it has proven successful in solving numerous problems in pure mathematics, multidimensional geometry, and differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Recent Breakthroughs
In recent years, there have been breakthroughs in the [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>:
*   **Particle Scattering Calculations**: String theorists and elementary particle physicists have begun to learn [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] because it allows for calculations of particle interactions, such as photon and gluon collisions or quark-photon scatterings, which were previously impossible or extremely difficult using conventional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Reforming Quantum Mechanics**: Researchers believe they now understand how to reformulate [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] using simple Newtonian gravity to explain the collapse (reduction) of the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. This involves understanding the non-locality inherent in both [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] (at a classical level) and [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## Non-Locality in Physics
[[Quantum mechanics and its implications | Quantum theory]] exhibits non-locality: when a particle's position is measured, its wave function instantaneously changes its state across the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. The [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] also possesses a non-local property, but at the level of [[Interplay between classical and quantum physics | classical physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. In [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]], a point does not correspond to a localized region but to an infinitely long line or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Experimental Verification
Despite its mathematical elegance, the [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] faces a significant hurdle: experimental verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Current experiments can only confirm or refute ideas from the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Observing the predictions of [[Relativity and quantum gravity | quantum gravity theory]], which [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] purports to address, is currently impossible under conditions in our galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Without experimental clues, theoretical physics is "walking blindly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Cosmological Constant and Quantum Effects
A proposed hypothesis connects the cosmological constant (dark energy), which drives the accelerating expansion of the universe, with quantum effects at the level of elementary particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:21">[02:12:21]</a>. The cosmological constant is a very small constant that can only be measured at the edges of the universe, which has a diameter of slightly less than 100 billion light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:26">[02:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Another very small constant in physics is the Planck constant, which describes how quantum effects become dominant over classical ones at the scale of a hydrogen atom (10<sup>-10</sup> meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

The idea suggests that the existence of the cosmological constant at the universe's edge should modify the Schrödinger equation at the atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This "crazy idea" posits that phenomena at cosmic scales could influence elementary particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. While counter-intuitive, mathematical analysis of the Schrödinger equation with gravitational effects supports this hypothesis, which has been presented within the framework of [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | Twistor theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
