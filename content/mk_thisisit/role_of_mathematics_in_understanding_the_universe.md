The study of mathematics plays a crucial role in the human endeavor to understand the nature of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This pursuit often involves tackling long-standing mathematical problems, the solutions to which can lead to significant breakthroughs in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Mathematics and the Fabric of Reality

The universe is often described through the lens of mathematics, suggesting that [[the_role_and_perception_of_mathematics_in_understanding_the_universe | mathematics is the language of nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This is evident in the evolution of scientific theories, from Aristotle to Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, all of which are mathematically consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Questions from pure mathematics often find connections with physical theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### The Metrizable Problem and Space-Time

A mathematical problem, open for 120 years, was recently solved, having great significance for the understanding of black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This is known as the "metrizable problem," posed by French mathematician Roger Liouville at the end of the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The core question is whether it's possible to recreate a concept of distance from a given family of curves such that these curves are the shortest paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

In [[the_relationship_between_mathematics_and_physics | Einstein's theory of gravity]], what we perceive as movement in a gravitational field (e.g., galaxies, planets) is actually movement along "geodesic lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These are the shortest lines in a certain concept of space-time metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Einstein's brilliant idea was to make this metric and the curvature of space-time dependent on matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The problem is whether, given the trajectories of all celestial bodies, one can recreate the space-time metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Nature appears to choose paths where this distance is either minimal or maximal, opting for the most economical way of moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Black Holes and Singularities

Understanding black holes represents a "quantum leap" in understanding the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. [[physics_and_mathematics_their_interplay_and_implications | Einstein's theory]] predicts the existence of black holes and even its own collapse within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Key aspects of black holes from a mathematical physics perspective:
*   **Singularities**: Works by Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking in the 1960s and 1970s showed that under physically reasonable assumptions, singularities are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. A singularity is a point or region in space-time where the curvature becomes infinitely large, and physics, as we know it, ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **Cosmic Censor Hypothesis**: A major unsolved problem is whether every singularity must be hidden inside an event horizon, a "membrane" from which nothing can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This hypothesis posits a "cosmic censor" that prevents us from directly observing singularities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This remains an open problem in the field of nonlinear differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Information Paradox**: Classically, information that falls into a black hole is lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. However, Stephen Hawking's attempt to reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity in the 1970s led to the concept of [[physics_and_mathematics_their_interplay_and_implications | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that black holes can evaporate over time due to particle-antiparticle creation near the event horizon, raising the question of whether information can eventually escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. This problem is still unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Observational Evidence**: Direct and indirect evidence for black holes has emerged in recent years from telescopes like gravitational wave observatories and the James Webb Telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. While black holes themselves are unobservable, their gravitational attraction on surrounding matter provides evidence of their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

## The Nature of Mathematics: Discovered or Created?

The question arises: Is [[independent_existence_of_mathematics | mathematics a science that describes or creates reality]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>
*   Mathematicians generally don't believe they create mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   Mathematics is seen as existing in its own world of abstract Platonic ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. Mathematical truths would remain true regardless of human civilization or even the universe's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.
*   We discover the mathematical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. The truth of theorems exists independently of human thought or action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   Mathematics is built upon axioms – fundamental rules or postulates that are not proven, but assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. Mathematicians then deduce truths from these axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

### Infinity in Mathematics and Physics

One of the mysteries related to [[independent_existence_of_mathematics | infinity]] is whether all infinities are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. While natural numbers and rational numbers have the same "countable" infinity, real numbers (including irrational numbers like pi or the square root of 2) constitute an "uncountable" infinity, which has a "greater power" in a mathematical sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. This raises the question of whether other types of infinity exist between these two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

Physics, however, appears unable to cope with infinity; everything describable in physics uses finite (though potentially huge) numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

### Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are considered the building blocks from which all other numbers are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. We know there are infinitely many prime numbers, a fact demonstrated by Euclid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. However, there is no known formula to derive prime numbers empirically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. In fact, it has been shown that such a general formula cannot exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

A fascinating unsolved problem is the "Twin Primes" conjecture: whether there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers differing only by two (e.g., 11 and 13, 17 and 19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. While computer simulations suggest this is true, a formal proof remains elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. Recent breakthroughs, such as Yitang Zhang's work on bounded gaps between primes, have shown that there are infinitely many pairs of primes within a certain large distance, which other mathematicians are working to reduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This often involves "algorithmic proofs" that rely heavily on computer verification, leading to a concern that these proofs lack the deeper understanding mathematicians seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.

### Fermat's Last Theorem

Fermat's Last Theorem, formulated by Pierre de Fermat over 300 years ago, states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. This theorem was famously proven by Andrew Wiles at Cambridge in 1994, using advanced [[influence_and_limitations_of_mathematics_in_scientific_theories | mathematical techniques]] (algebraic number theory, modular forms theory) unknown to Fermat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. The proof was exceptionally complex and initially contained an error, which was subsequently patched by Wiles and others, notably Richard Taylor, several years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>. This serves as an example of how old problems can drive the creation of entirely new fields of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## Mathematics as a Tool and its Limitations

While mathematics is an exceptionally effective tool for sciences like physics, chemistry, and biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>, its technical specialization can lead to hermeticism, making communication difficult even among mathematicians from different subfields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>.

### Current Challenges: Quantum Theory and Unification

Current research in mathematical physics, such as the work with Roger Penrose, focuses on problems in quantum theory, specifically the "reduction of the wave function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. Quantum theory introduced probability calculus to physics, suggesting that nature is fundamentally non-deterministic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. An elementary particle can be in a superposition of all possible states until a measurement is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

Penrose's theory suggests that quantum mechanics is not a complete theory and that gravitational effects must be taken into account to explain why massive objects are not observed in superposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. This proposal, controversial among physicists, aims to modify the Schrödinger equation so that wave function collapse becomes a physical process influenced by gravity, with the reduction time inversely proportional to mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

This research contributes to the larger pursuit of a "grand unification theory," which seeks to connect all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. Many believe that to achieve this, the theory of gravity must be changed or replaced by a quantum theory of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. However, an alternative approach, explored by Penrose and collaborators, suggests revisiting the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Promoting Mathematical Research in Africa

Beyond theoretical pursuits, there are practical efforts to foster [[importance_of_mathematical_education_and_research | mathematical education and research]]. Institutes have been established in various African countries (e.g., South Africa, Senegal, Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania) to nurture mathematical talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>. These initiatives aim to provide students with advanced training and guide young scientists towards significant research problems, fostering a strong scientific system within Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.
