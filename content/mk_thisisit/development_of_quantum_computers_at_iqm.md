Jakub Rożek, who defended his doctorate at Oxford University, is currently creating a [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]] in Helsinki with IQM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. IQM is described as the largest private company in Europe that creates [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The company's headquarters are located in Espoo, Finland, very close to Helsinki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Current Development and Future Goals

IQM is actively working on a 150-qubit [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, which is currently being measured and calibrated in a freezer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This development is a significant step towards achieving a [[potential_of_universal_quantum_computers|universal quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, which would be capable of executing any quantum algorithm with an arbitrarily small error rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The current limitation in executing quantum algorithms is noise, which leads to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

IQM's roadmap aims to announce a one-million-qubit [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]] by 2033 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. However, for such large numbers of qubits, the focus shifts to "logical qubits" through quantum error correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## How [[Quantum computers and their challenges|Quantum Computers]] Work

Unlike classical computers that operate on bits (zeros and ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] use qubits (quantum bits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The main difference is that a classical bit can only be 0 or 1 at a given moment, whereas a qubit can exist in any state between zero and one (superposition), allowing for many more different states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Furthermore, with multiple qubits, their collective state cannot be described by simply detailing each one separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This concept, known as quantum entanglement, means "the whole is greater than the sum of the parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Entanglement is a "dance" where qubits interact with each other, making it impossible to describe them by looking at each one separately; one must look at them together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This phenomenon is a primary difficulty in describing or simulating [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] on classical machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## [[Quantum computing technologies|Technology at IQM]]

IQM primarily focuses on superconducting transmons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. These are very small loops with current that can flow for extended periods due to superconductivity, meaning there is no resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. When such a qubit is cooled to a very low temperature, it begins to behave quantumly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

IQM's [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|computers]] operate at temperatures very close to absolute zero (about 120 degrees above relative zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This extremely low temperature slows down particle movement, revealing quantum effects where matter cannot move at any speed but only at specific, allowed speeds or energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The goal is to reach a state where only one or two allowed energy levels remain, as a qubit requires at least two energy levels to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

The large, golden, fridge-like structure of a [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]] is primarily a cryogenic cooling system and cabling, not the quantum computer chip itself, which is very small and located at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. The design aims to limit heat transmission and losses, ensuring the chip's temperature remains unaffected by external devices or signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Other [[Quantum computing technologies|Technologies]]

While IQM focuses on superconducting transmons, other [[quantum_computing_technologies|technologies]] for building [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] include [[quantum_computers_and_cold_atoms|cold atoms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## [[Engineering challenges in the development of quantum computers|Engineering Challenges]] and [[Progress in quantum computing and cryptography|Progress]]

The path to scaling up [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] faces significant [[engineering_challenges_in_the_development_of_quantum_computers|engineering challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. One major hurdle is cabling: each qubit requires its own steering and control mechanisms, meaning about two cables per qubit currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. A million-qubit computer would require a million cables if current methods were maintained, necessitating new solutions like connecting multiple chips or developing different wiring methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This requires ensuring data transfer between chips remains quantum, allowing them to remain entangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

A revolutionary development in [[progress_in_quantum_computing_and_cryptography|quantum computing progress]] this year was Google's confirmation of achieving quantum error correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Google demonstrated the creation of a "logical qubit" that lives longer than any physical qubit, proving that quantum error correction works as predicted, exponentially reducing errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This breakthrough is crucial for large-scale [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]], allowing separation and control of individual qubits even in large systems, circumventing the issue of thermodynamic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

## Applications of [[Quantum computers and their challenges|Quantum Computers]]

One of the greatest motivations for working on [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] is their potential to simulate nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. All chemical phenomena, such as photosynthesis, medicine, and pharmacology, are inherently quantum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While classical methods can approximate these, [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] will allow for a much better understanding of chemical processes and enable faster creation of new drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

There are also studies on simulating cosmology on a [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]], exploring the fabric of space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This could potentially lead to a redefinition of the concept of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## [[Quantum computers and artificial intelligence|Quantum Machine Learning]]

[[Quantum computers and artificial intelligence|Quantum machine learning]] combines [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] with standard machine learning techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. There are three main varieties:
1.  Using a normal classical computer to learn from quantum data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
2.  Using a [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]] to work on classical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. This field holds significant business potential, as it can accelerate the solution of optimization problems and other mathematical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
3.  Using a [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]] to work on quantum data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## Accessibility and Business Model

At present, IQM's five-qubit [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] can cost around one million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. The high price is largely due to the prototype nature of the technology and the [[engineering_challenges_in_the_development_of_quantum_computers|engineering solutions]] required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. As the technology develops and solutions are found, prices are expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. However, [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] are not expected to become consumer products for home use; instead, they will likely remain in supercomputer centers, accessible via the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

### Quantum Cloud

The "quantum cloud" is IQM's system for making its [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]] in Espoo accessible via the internet to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. This involves maintaining the computer's calibration and cooling to ensure optimal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. Customers are primarily research centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.

## Quantum Internet and Security Implications

The concept of a "quantum internet" involves a network that can transmit quantum information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. While the speaker doesn't know much about it, they believe that standard classical internet is sufficient for communicating with [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]], as every [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]] relies on a large classical computer for control and operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

Current research on quantum internet involves fiber optic networks, such as those in England, used by researchers to send quantum-entangled photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. This is a difficult [[engineering_challenges_in_the_development_of_quantum_computers|engineering problem]] because signal amplifiers kill quantum information, meaning the entanglement chain cannot be interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. Europe is considered stronger than the United States in this area of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

Regarding security, there are concerns that a [[potential_of_universal_quantum_computers|universal quantum computer]] could break current encryption methods like RSA codes, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into prime factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. However, experts have been developing new, less susceptible coding algorithms for over 20 years, known as [[progress_in_quantum_computing_and_cryptography|quantum cryptography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Banks are advised to implement these new algorithms now to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. Quantum key distribution, based on quantum entanglement, is one such method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

## IQM's Team and Collaborations

Jakub Rożek, a physicist with a doctorate from Oxford, moved to Finland specifically for the job at IQM, believing that [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers]] can change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. He works in the calibration department, focusing on the control and quantum gates of the [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]], from cooling the chip to making it usable, by creating and calibrating quantum gates to reduce noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

IQM collaborates with Polish institutions, including a project with Gdańsk University of Technology to connect their [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computer]] to a supercomputer and test quantum-classical algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. IQM also has a sales office in Warsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.
