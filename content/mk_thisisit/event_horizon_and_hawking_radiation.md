## Event Horizon

[[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | Black holes]] are defined as regions in [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:53]</a>. These regions are limited on one side by a membrane known as the [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[01:02]</a>.

The fundamental properties of the [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | event horizon]] are that everything inside it, including light, can only fall in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[01:10]</a>. Conversely, nothing, not even light or information, can fall out of the [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[01:17]</a>. An observer situated outside this membrane has no insight into what is happening inside and never will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[01:20]</a>.

### Information Paradox

Initially, studies suggested that whatever enters a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] is not only completely mixed but also erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[01:31]</a>. However, the current scientific consensus is that information eventually emerges from the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] in a very mixed form, recorded within the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[01:42]</a>. The principle of nature suggests that information is conserved and cannot be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[03:48]</a>. This means, theoretically, if one were to burn a book, all emitted light, heat, atoms, photons, and smoke particles could be measured to rebuild the book perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[03:57]</a>. This concept clashes with the idea of information being lost within a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]]. The crucial question then becomes: if something enters a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] and the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] later disappears, and all radiation comes from the [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | event horizon]] and the vacuum of space, how is the fallen-in information finally recorded in that radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[03:01]</a>?

### Singularities and the Cosmic Censor Hypothesis

The collapse of material, like a cloud of dust, into what is now called a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]], leads to the formation of a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[08:30]</a>. A singularity is a point of infinite density, as described by Oppenheimer and Snyder in their work on dust collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[09:03]</a>.

A hypothesis known as the **Cosmic Censor Hypothesis** proposes that all singularities must be hidden inside the [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[13:53]</a>. This "cosmic censor" prevents us from gaining direct insight into the nature of these singularities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[14:08]</a>. However, whether there must always be a horizon surrounding a singularity remains an open and mathematically interesting problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[14:14]</a>.

Understanding [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] and their [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | event horizons]] is expected to result in a quantum leap in the understanding of theoretical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[14:34]</a>.

## Hawking Radiation

[[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | Black holes]] are described in [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's theory]] as pure [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time]] – simply the geometry of [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[02:33]</a>. Radiation, known as [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking | Hawking radiation]], emanates from the [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | event horizon]] of a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[02:43]</a>.

This radiation is thought to originate from the vacuum of space itself, not from matter that has fallen into the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[02:54]</a>. It is almost as if the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] vibrates or tears this radiation from the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[02:51]</a>.

### Discovery and Mechanism

[[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking | Stephen Hawking]] discovered that [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] have their own lifespan and will eventually evaporate through a process called [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[06:49]</a>. He made an attempt to reconcile quantum mechanics with the theory of gravity, despite the lack of a quantum theory of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[07:10]</a>.

His calculation involved quantum mechanical particles near the [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | event horizon]] of the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[07:27]</a>. The method [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking | Hawking]] used was related to **pair creation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[07:38]</a>. Quantum theory dictates that at sufficiently high energies, a particle and its antiparticle can be created simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[07:44]</a>. If this occurs near the [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | event horizon]], it's possible that the antiparticle falls into the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] while the particle escapes and moves towards infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[07:58]</a>. This process of particle emission is what constitutes [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking | Hawking radiation]].

### Implications

The existence of [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking | Hawking radiation]] implies that [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]], despite their immense mass, will eventually evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[04:20]</a>. This process is exceedingly slow for typical [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]], taking approximately 10^100 (one with a hundred zeros) years for them to finally evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[06:36]</a>.

During the evaporation process, a critical question arises: what happens to the information, energy, and matter that fell into the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[04:51]</a>? [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking | Stephen Hawking's]] initial calculations denied that information could exit from the other side of a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[02:10]</a>, suggesting there might have been inaccuracies in those early calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[02:15]</a>.

### Connection to Galaxy Collisions

When galaxies collide, such as the predicted collision between the Andromeda Galaxy and our Milky Way, their central [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] will eventually merge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[05:16]</a>. Andromeda's central [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] is much larger and will eventually absorb our galaxy's [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[05:54]</a>. This new, larger [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | supermassive black hole]] will then begin absorbing the entire galactic cluster, which can contain millions of galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[06:14]</a>. Even these massive [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] will eventually evaporate through the [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking | Hawking evaporation]] phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[06:44]</a>.

## Wormholes and Event Horizons

Speculative interpretations of complex mathematics suggest the existence of [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormholes]] that could open from the inside of a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] to the outside, potentially allowing information to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[09:59]</a>. However, there is currently no evidence for this, and it remains a highly speculative idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[10:02]</a>.

The concept of [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormholes]], specifically the Einstein-Rosen bridge, arises from the work of [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein]] and Rosen in the mid-1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[11:13]</a>. This is a property of [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] discovered in 1916 within the context of "eternal [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]]" – theoretical [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] that have always existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[11:29]</a>. A formal mathematical solution for such a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] includes a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]], a white hole, and a [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time tunnel]] connecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[11:37]</a>.

However, these theoretical [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormholes]] are generally believed to be unstable and impassable due to their internal time and space distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[13:16]</a>. To construct a stable [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time tunnel]] through which one could travel, forms of energy or matter currently unknown in the universe would be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[11:59]</a>. While theoretically possible, traversable [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormholes]] likely do not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[13:05]</a>. When two [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] merge to form a [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time tunnel]], it implies they must be completely entangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[12:42]</a>.
