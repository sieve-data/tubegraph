Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, started [[starting_to_invest_in_the_stock_market | investing with just a thousand dollars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He has shared several key techniques on how to [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | invest with little money]] in the stock market and achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This article compiles seven of these techniques for successful stock market [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | investing with little capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Individuals are responsible for their own [[investment opportunities in the stock market | investment decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## 1. Invest in Good Businesses

The first and most important principle is to invest in good businesses that can generate a high return for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By researching a stock once, investors can benefit for 10, 15, or 20 years from the value it generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This approach allows investors to benefit from the effect of compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. In contrast, buying a poor-quality stock just because it is cheap often requires immediate selling after a small gain, as it won't generate long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Identifying a "Good Business"
A good business is defined by its "moat" or competitive advantage—something special that allows it to prosper against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This advantage is often intangible or qualitative, requiring critical thinking rather than just quantifiable metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

*   **Examples of Good Businesses:**
    *   **American Express:** Operates in a near-monopoly of three credit card companies (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), offering an essential product that facilitates payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Its "network effect" means more businesses accepting the card lead to more customers wanting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This allows them to raise prices (e.g., merchant fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Historically, American Express has seen returns of 1200% since 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Google:** Considered by Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's partner) to have the greatest competitive advantage globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Since its IPO, it has multiplied its value by almost 50 times in 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Google controls the main search engine and YouTube, allowing it to raise advertising prices without many alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   **Coca-Cola/Nike:** These companies have strong brands, which are a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. When consumers think of a non-alcoholic soft drink, Coca-Cola or Pepsi come to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. They can control their selling prices because their products are desired, and customers are willing to continue consuming them even with a 10% price increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Similarly, Nike has few major competitors like Under Armour or Adidas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   **Disney:** Owns iconic franchises like Mickey Mouse, Marvel, and amusement parks, making it difficult to compete in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Disney can raise attraction prices (e.g., from $3.50 in 1971 to over $160 today for Disney World) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, significantly outperforming inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This pricing power, coupled with volume growth from new consumers, ensures continued profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

*   **Examples of Bad Businesses:**
    *   **US Steel Corporation:** A commodity business with no significant technological competitive advantage, meaning rivals can easily replicate its production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The company does not control the sale price, which is dictated by supply and demand on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Demand for steel fluctuates with economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Over ten years, US Steel yielded only 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   **American Airlines:** Operates in a sector with high competition and supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. If American Airlines raises airfares by 10%, customers will switch to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   **Toll Brothers:** A cyclical home builder business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. They cannot freely raise house prices by 10% because consumers do not care about the brand when identical houses are available next door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   **General Motors:** One of over 40 global car manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Differentiation is difficult, and customer brand loyalty is low, often rotating brands over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Importance of Long-Term Performance
If a company has performed well on the stock market for 10, 15, or 20 years, it is typically not due to luck but because it is a good business that has generated value and prospered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Conversely, a company that has moved sideways for decades suggests a lack of special qualities for long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## 2. Invest Only in Businesses You Understand

Warren Buffett advises against [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | investing in a business]] you do not understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Understanding a business goes beyond knowing its products (e.g., Disney sells movies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. It means having certainty that the company's profits will remain stable or, preferably, increase over the next five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

*   **Understanding Example: Disney:** Consumers appreciate Disney products and show loyalty, allowing the company to raise prices by 5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Combined with volume growth from more consumers, this enables Disney to grow 5-10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The company can then reinvest profits through dividends or share buybacks, compounding value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Not Understanding Example: Moderna:** It is difficult to predict vaccine production profits five years in the future, as new solutions could emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Without certainty of future profits, Warren Buffett would not invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Warren Buffett encourages investors to expand their "circle of competence" by learning about new sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.# Investing with Little Money in the Stock Market

## 2. Invest Only in Businesses You Understand

Warren Buffett advises against [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | investing in a business]] you do not understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Understanding a business goes beyond knowing its products (e.g., Disney sells movies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. It means having certainty that the company's profits will remain stable or, preferably, increase over the next five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

Without certainty of future profits, Warren Buffett would not invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Warren Buffett encourages investors to expand their "circle of competence" by learning about new sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. However, it is crucial to be honest about what you understand and not be tempted by greed to invest in fads without understanding their fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

## 3. When You See an Opportunity, Take Advantage of It

Warren Buffett states that the stock market is a mechanism to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This means taking advantage of opportunities that arise during market panics or specific company problems.

*   **Market Panics (e.g., March 2020 Virus Crisis):** During widespread panic, stock valuations become ridiculously low, even for non-cyclical stocks that are unaffected long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Patient investors who understand asset valuation can buy cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Individual Stock Problems (e.g., Volkswagen "Dieselgate"):** Volkswagen's stock plummeted from €250 to €80 due to a scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Patient investors who waited three years for the panic to subside could reap profits when the stock recovered to €250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Bank of America during the Financial Crisis:** Buffett invested over $5 billion in Bank of America (BofA) shares at around $5 per share during the 2009-2011 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. He understood that central banks would rescue the banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Despite waiting until 2018 for the stock to reach $30, he multiplied his investment by six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola "New Coke" Debacle (1985):** When Coca-Cola released an unpopular new formula, its stock dropped significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Buffett realized the company could simply revert to the old formula, which it did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. He bought shares at an attractive 13 times earnings and has since multiplied his investment by 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Apple (2016):** Buffett invested $15 billion in Apple when sales stagnated and the market feared its move to larger screens was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. Apple was trading at a historical valuation minimum of six times earnings (excluding cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Recognizing customer loyalty, he saw potential for growth even if profits only remained flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This investment multiplied by six times, becoming one of his best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **American Express Scandal (1960s):** Buffett invested when American Express suffered a scandal due to a client defrauding the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. Despite headlines suggesting widespread fraud, he understood it was an isolated error and the company remained solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

These situations present opportunities to buy good companies at low prices, provided the problems are temporary and can be analyzed with certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. If an investor cannot confidently answer whether the issue is temporary, they should not invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

### [[investment_in_small_caps_and_private_investing | Investment in Small Caps]]
Warren Buffett suggests that with less capital, such as when [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | investing with little money]], there are more opportunities in [[role_of_small_and_lesserknown_stocks_in_investment_portfolios | small and medium-sized companies]] to achieve higher returns than larger funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. For example, True Value Small Caps fund bought an engineering company that dropped due to weak quarters and concerns about accounting deficiencies (which turned out to be conservative accounting, not fraud) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. This provided an opportunity to buy a good business at a low price, which later recovered significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

It is important not to be influenced by past price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. A stock that has not performed well in the short term might still be a good business with future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Also, do not feel bad about missing opportunities you do not understand; focus on what you can analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

## 4. Don't Be in a Hurry to Sell (Patience)

Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's partner, states that "real money is not found in the constant buying and selling but in waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. Rich investors achieve wealth by finding investments that multiply many times over and waiting patiently as these companies generate value long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

*   **Wells Fargo Example:** Buffett invested in Wells Fargo in 1990-91 at $2.75 a share, and it reached $30 in 20 years, multiplying by 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. Despite periods where the price remained sideways (e.g., 1993-1996) or even corrected by 20-30%, the underlying business profits grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
*   **Adobe Example:** An investment in Adobe in 2014 multiplied by 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. Despite significant corrections (40% in 2017, 70% during the 2020 virus crisis), patience allowed for substantial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

Having deep knowledge of a business fosters patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This knowledge allows investors to remain calm even when others are selling, knowing the company's future value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. The stock market is there to serve you, not to instruct you; a price drop does not automatically mean the stock is bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. All good long-term stocks will experience volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

## 5. Enjoy Investing

To succeed in the stock market, one must enjoy the process of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. People who invest solely for money often fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Success comes from those who enjoy the mental challenge, learning about businesses, and applying their analysis to make informed bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

## 6. Don't Be Envious or Greedy

Envy and greed are detrimental in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>. Many people cannot tolerate seeing others get rich, especially in "hot" or fashionable sectors, leading them to abandon sound investment principles to join the latest trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. This is often the worst thing an investor can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.

*   **Dot-Com Bubble (Year 2000):** During the dot-com bubble, when tech stocks soared, many criticized Warren Buffett for his traditional [[investment strategies in small caps and favorable market segments | investment strategy]] and his Berkshire Hathaway shares underperformed the Nasdaq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. However, when the bubble burst, the Nasdaq fell by 60% in 18 months, while Berkshire Hathaway's shares became more valuable than the tech stocks within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Moody's Example (2015-2017):** While the broader market was rising, Moody's shares moved sideways for two years, making it less "fashionable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>. However, its strong fundamentals (competitive advantage, predictable business model) led to its value being recognized later, multiplying by four times in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. Resisting the temptation to chase other stocks during its stagnant period proved beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

When [[starting_to_invest_in the_stock_market | investing with little capital]], new investors are more vulnerable to joining fads due to inexperience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. It's crucial to resist looking in the rearview mirror and chasing past gains, as this can lead to buying overvalued assets that are ripe for correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>.

## 7. Be Sensitive to Asset Valuations

Warren Buffett defines intrinsic value as the discounted cash flows over the remaining life of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. While this is the theoretical definition, he and Charlie Munger do not strictly use the discounted cash flow formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>. Intrinsic value is a subjective estimate, which can be calculated using various methods, such as multiples of earnings (P/E) or EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

*   **Coca-Cola Intrinsic Value Example:** Over time, Coca-Cola's intrinsic value (blue line) steadily increases because it makes more money and pays more dividends each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>. The stock price (red line) tends to replicate this intrinsic value over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. The ideal time to buy is when there's a significant difference between the intrinsic value and the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.
*   **Predictable vs. Cyclical Businesses:** Investors should prefer companies whose intrinsic value is steadily increasing (e.g., Coca-Cola, Microsoft), as these tend to have predictable and stable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. Cyclical companies (e.g., energy companies whose intrinsic value fluctuates with oil prices) are riskier as their profits rise and fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>.

## 8. Invest in Companies with Good Management

Warren Buffett believes that good management, focused on the long term, tends to produce good benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. This aligns with the proverb, "If someone is sitting in the shade, it is because someone planted a tree a long time ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. Good managers often credit current success to work done years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>.

### Indicators of Good Management:
*   **Alignment with Shareholders:** Family companies, or those with a reference shareholder who has a significant investment, tend to perform better than companies without such alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.
*   **Long Tenure and Stock Ownership:** A manager who has been in charge for 10-15 years and has seen the stock perform well is a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. Significant personal stock ownership (e.g., stock value ten times their salary) indicates a high degree of incentive for the shares to do well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
*   **Actions, Not Just Words:** Evaluate managers by their track record. If a company consistently meets its growth targets (e.g., 15% growth for five years), it's a good indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>. If profits have been flat for ten years despite promises of 20% growth, it's harder to believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.

## 9. Invest in Yourself

Warren Buffett states that the best [[investment opportunities in the stock market | investment you can make]] is to invest in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. There is a direct correlation between knowledge of the stock market and economic benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. Even with little money, one can accelerate the process of building wealth through education, potentially leading to professional careers as analysts or fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.
