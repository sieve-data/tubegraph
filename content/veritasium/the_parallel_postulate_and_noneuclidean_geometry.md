A single sentence in one of the oldest math books, [[Euclids Elements and Its Influence on Mathematics | Euclid's "Elements"]], held the key to understanding the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. [[Euclids Elements and Its Influence on Mathematics | Euclid's "Elements"]] has been published in more editions than any other book except the Bible, serving as the go-to math text for over 2,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. For much of this time, mathematicians were skeptical of a particular line that seemed like a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Ultimately, it was realized that Euclid was not wrong, but "slight tweaks to this line opened up strange new universes out of nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Eighty years later, these "strange new universes" were found to be core to understanding our own universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Euclid's Foundation of Mathematics

Around 300 BC, the Greek mathematician Euclid undertook a massive project to summarize all mathematics known at the time in a single book, [[Euclids Elements and Its Influence on Mathematics | "The Elements"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Before Euclid, mathematical proofs often went "around in circles," leading to an infinite recursion of fundamental reasons for truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Euclid resolved this by accepting a few simple, basic things as true, called postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Based on these postulates, theorems could be proved one at a time, building up mathematics logically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This method perfected the "gold standard for rigorous mathematical proof" that all modern math relies on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

[[Euclids Elements and Its Influence on Mathematics | "The Elements"]] is a 13-book series in which Euclid proved 465 theorems covering geometry and number theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These theorems relied on definitions, common notions, and five postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Euclid's Definitions and Postulates

[[Euclids Elements and Its Influence on Mathematics | Book One]] of "The Elements" begins with definitions, such as "A point is that which has no part" and "A line is a breadthless length" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. After 23 definitions, the text lists the five postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The first four postulates are considered simple:
1.  If you have two points, you can draw a straight line between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
2.  If you have a straight line, you can extend it indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Given a center and a radius, you can draw a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
4.  All right angles are equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

However, the fifth postulate is notably complex and lengthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:
> If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side, on which are the angles less than the two right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## The Parallel Postulate: A Source of Suspicion

The complexity of the fifth postulate made mathematicians suspicious, believing it might be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The Greek philosopher Proclus suggested it "ought even to be struck outta the postulates altogether, for it is a theorem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. If it were a theorem, it should be provable from the first four postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Many, including Ptolemy and Proclus, attempted to prove it but only managed to restate it in different words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

One common formulation of the fifth postulate is: "If you have a line, and a point that is not on that line, then there is a single unique line which will be parallel to the first line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. For this reason, it is often called the Parallel Postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

When direct proof failed, mathematicians like al-Haytham and Omar Khayyam tried proof by contradiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This involved keeping the first four postulates and assuming the fifth postulate was false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. If this led to a contradiction, it would prove Euclid's fifth postulate correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Two alternatives for a false fifth postulate were considered:
1.  **No parallel lines**: This alternative was ruled out because it implied that lines had to be finite in length, contradicting Euclid's second postulate that lines can be extended indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
2.  **More than one parallel line**: Mathematicians "couldn't find the contradiction" when assuming more than one parallel line could be drawn through a point not on the first line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

After over 2,000 years, all attempts to prove the fifth postulate failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## The Birth of Non-Euclidean Geometries

Around 1820, 17-year-old János Bolyai began working on the mystery of the parallel postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Despite his father's warning not to attempt this "bottomless night" of a problem, Bolyai persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. After years, he realized the fifth postulate "can't be proven from the other four, it could be completely independent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Hyperbolic Geometry

Bolyai imagined a world where more than one parallel line could exist through a point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This is possible on a curved surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Although lines on such a surface might appear bent, "straight lines" are defined as the shortest paths between two points, known as geodesics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This concept gave rise to [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | hyperbolic geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Hyperbolic geometry can be visualized as an "infinite crumpling mess," like a crocheted surface that starts flat in the middle but creates more and more fabric outwards, pushing parallel lines apart exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. To map the entire [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | hyperbolic plane]], the Poincare Disk Model is used, which fits the infinite plane into a finite disc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. In this model, triangles appear smaller further from the center but are actually the same size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Straight lines are arcs of circles intersecting the disk at 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Bolyai did not have a physical model but found that the behavior in [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | hyperbolic geometry]] was mathematically consistent with Euclid's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

In 1823, Bolyai wrote to his father, "Out of nothing, I have created a strange new universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. He published his findings in 1832 as a 24-page appendix to his father's textbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Independent Discoveries and Consistency

Farkas Bolyai sent his son's work to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who replied that the content "coincides almost exactly with my own meditations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Gauss had privately discovered a "curious geometry" in 1824 with "paradoxical" and "absurd theorems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. For example, in this geometry, "The three angles of a triangle become as small as one wishes, if only the sides are taken large enough. Yet the area of the triangle can never exceed a definite limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Gauss found that all his efforts to find a contradiction in this geometry were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. He named it [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | non-Euclidean geometry]], a term that stuck, describing geometries where Euclid's first four postulates hold, but the fifth does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Gauss chose not to publish his findings due to "fear of ridicule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

In 1848, Bolyai learned that Nikolai Lobachevsky had independently discovered [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | non-Euclidean geometry]] years before his publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Bolyai died in 1860, unaware of Gauss's independent discovery or his praise for Bolyai as a "genius of the first order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

### Spherical (Elliptic) Geometry

Spherical geometry, which humans are familiar with as we live on a sphere, is another example of a [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | non-Euclidean geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. On a sphere, "straight lines" are parts of great circles (circles with the largest possible circumference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Any two great circles will always intersect at two points, meaning "on a sphere, there are no parallel lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

Initially, spherical geometry wasn't considered [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | non-Euclidean]] because lines cannot be extended indefinitely, violating Euclid's second postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. However, in 1854, Riemann changed the second postulate from an "infinite extension" to "unbounded," allowing it to hold on a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. With this, spherical or elliptic geometry became another valid [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | non-Euclidean geometry]], derivable by generalizing the first four postulates and assuming no parallel lines for the fifth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami proved that [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | hyperbolic]] and spherical geometry were just as consistent as Euclid's flat geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Modern Geometry and its Real-World Applications

While Euclid was right to include the fifth postulate, his use of definitions like "A point is that which has no part" was problematic, as they could lead to infinite recursion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Modern mathematics addresses this by using "undefined terms" and focusing on the relationships between objects defined by postulates, rather than attempting to define the objects themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Geometry can be thought of as a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. The first four postulates are minimum rules, and the fifth postulate selects the world in which the game is played <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>:
*   **Spherical Geometry**: No parallel lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Flat (Euclidean) Geometry**: One parallel line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **[[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | Hyperbolic Geometry]]**: More than one parallel line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

Riemann, in 1854, further developed this by laying groundwork for a geometry where curvature could differ from place to place and could be extended to three or more dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

### [[Applications of NonEuclidean Geometry in General Relativity | Applications of Non-Euclidean Geometry in General Relativity]]

In 1905, Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity, which made space and time relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This created a problem for Newtonian gravity, where force depends on distance, which was no longer well-defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Einstein reconciled relativity and gravity with his "happiest thought" in 1907, realizing that free-falling observers feel weightless and are in fact inertial observers, not experiencing gravity as a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

If gravity is not a force, then objects like the space station orbiting Earth are actually traveling in a straight line, but this straight line appears curved to a distant observer because "the space time that straight line is on is curved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Massive objects curve spacetime, and objects moving through this curved spacetime follow the shortest path, or geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Thus, "the behavior of straight lines in curved geometries is core to understanding the universe we live in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

[[Applications of NonEuclidean Geometry in General Relativity | The general theory of relativity]] has been remarkably successful, supported by countless findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Gravitational Lensing**: In 2014, astronomers observed the same supernova in four different places because a massive galaxy between the supernova and Earth curved spacetime, causing light to take multiple paths to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. This phenomenon allowed them to predict and observe a replay of the supernova a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Gravitational Waves**: We can now measure ripples in spacetime itself, formed by cosmic events like the merger of black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. A recent survey suggests that the fabric of spacetime is "buzzing with the remnants of grand cosmic events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

At the core of [[Applications of NonEuclidean Geometry in General Relativity | general relativity]] are the "paradoxical and seemingly absurd geometries" developed by Bolyai and Riemann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

### The Shape of the Universe

The shape of the entire universe can be determined by measuring the angles of a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>:
*   **Flat geometry**: Angles add up to 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Spherical geometry**: Angles add up to more than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **[[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | Hyperbolic geometry]]**: Angles add up to less than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

Gauss attempted to measure the angles of a large triangle formed by three mountains, finding them to be 180 degrees within observational error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. However, this triangle would have been far too small relative to the size of the universe to detect any significant curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

To overcome this scale issue, astronomers use the largest possible triangles by looking back in time to the earliest light, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. The CMB is a picture of the universe when it was just 380,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. By knowing the distance to the CMB and predicting the expected size of "hot or colder" spots based on early universe evolution, a "cosmic triangle" can be formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

If the universe is flat, the measured angle on the sky should match predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. If spherical, the angle would be larger; if [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | hyperbolic]], it would appear smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. Data from the Plank mission shows the universe is "almost exactly what you'd expect if the universe were flat," with a curvature measurement of 0.0007 ± 0.0019, which is "basically zero within the margin of error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

The flatness of the universe is "remarkably serendipitous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. The average mass energy density is about six hydrogen atoms per cubic meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. If it were one more hydrogen atom, the universe would be more spherically curved; if one less, it would be [[The Parallel Postulate and NonEuclidean Geometry | hyperbolic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. The reason for this precise mass energy density is not yet fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
