From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Euclid's "Elements" is one of the oldest math books, published in more editions than any other book except the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For over 2,000 years, it served as the primary math text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, mathematicians were skeptical of a single line, Postulate 5, which seemed like a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Slight tweaks to this postulate eventually led to the discovery of strange new universes, which were later found to be core to understanding our own universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Euclid's Grand Project

Around 300 BC, the Greek mathematician Euclid undertook a massive project to summarize all known mathematics, aiming to create a comprehensive single book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Before Euclid, mathematics faced a problem: proofs often went in circles, leading to an infinite recursion of fundamental reasons for truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Euclid adopted a solution pioneered by the Greeks: accept a few simple, basic things as true (postulates), and then logically prove theorems one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This method, which he perfected, became the gold standard for rigorous mathematical proof that modern math relies on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Euclid published his 13-book series, "The Elements," proving 465 theorems covering geometry and number theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. All these theorems depended on definitions, common notions, and five postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### The Five Postulates

Euclid's "Elements" begins with 23 definitions, such as "A point is that which has no part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Following these, he presents five postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>:
1.  A straight line can be drawn between any two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
2.  A straight line can be extended indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Given a center and a radius, a circle can be drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
4.  All right angles are equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The fifth postulate, however, stands out due to its complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:
> If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side, on which are the angles less than the two right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

This verbose and less obvious statement immediately raised suspicions among mathematicians, who thought it might be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## The Quest to Prove the Fifth Postulate

Greek philosopher Proclus believed Postulate 5 should be a theorem, meaning it should be provable from the first four postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Many, including Ptolemy and Proclus, attempted direct proofs but failed, only managing to restate the postulate in different words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. One common formulation of the fifth postulate is the "Parallel Postulate": if you have a line and a point not on that line, then there is a single unique line which will be parallel to the first line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

When direct proof failed, mathematicians like al-Haytham and Omar Khayyam tried proof by contradiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This method involves keeping the first four postulates true but assuming the fifth postulate is false. If this leads to a contradiction (e.g., true equals false), then Euclid's original fifth postulate must be correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Two main alternatives to the fifth postulate were explored:
1.  **No parallel lines through the point**: This alternative was ruled out because it implied that lines had to be finite in length, contradicting Euclid's second postulate that lines can be extended indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
2.  **More than one parallel line through the point**: Mathematicians pursued this alternative, but despite extensive effort, they couldn't find a contradiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

For over 2,000 years, mathematicians failed to prove the fifth postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## The Dawn of [[NonEuclidean Geometries and Jnos Bolyai | Non-Euclidean Geometries]]

Around 1820, a 17-year-old student named [[NonEuclidean Geometries and Jnos Bolyai | János Bolyai]] dedicated himself to the mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. His father, Farkas Bolyai, warned him against it, having traversed the "bottomless night" of this problem himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Yet, young Bolyai persisted, eventually realizing that the fifth postulate might be completely independent of the other four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Bolyai imagined a world where more than one parallel line could be drawn through a point not on a given line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This led him to consider a world that was not flat, but curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. On such a curved surface, the shortest paths between two points (called geodesics) might appear bent from an outside perspective, but are considered "straight" within that geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This new world Bolyai imagined became known as hyperbolic geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

A good analogy for the hyperbolic plane is a piece of crocheting that starts flat in the middle but grows exponentially outwards, causing a crumpling effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. To visualize the infinite hyperbolic plane, the Poincare Disk Model is used, mapping the entire infinite plane into a finite disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. In this model, "straight lines" are arcs of circles that intersect the disk at 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Triangles appear smaller towards the edge, but are actually the same size, causing angles to approach zero as sides extend to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Despite the strange behavior, Bolyai found that hyperbolic geometry seemed mathematically consistent, just as much as Euclid's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. In 1823, he famously wrote to his father, "Out of nothing, I have created a strange new universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Bolyai published his findings in 1832 as an appendix to his father's textbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Farkas sent it to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who responded that the work coincided almost exactly with his own meditations over the past 30-35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Gauss had privately discovered a "curious geometry" in 1824, one with "paradoxical, and to the uninitiated, absurd theorems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. For instance, in this geometry, the angles of a triangle can become arbitrarily small if sides are large enough, yet the triangle's area can never exceed a definite limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Like Bolyai, Gauss found this geometry thoroughly consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, naming it [[NonEuclidean Geometries and Jnos Bolyai | non-Euclidean geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. However, Gauss feared ridicule and chose not to publish his findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

Bolyai was devastated by Gauss's response, believing his ideas were stolen, and never published again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. In 1848, he further learned that Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky had independently discovered [[NonEuclidean Geometries and Jnos Bolyai | non-Euclidean geometry]] years before Bolyai's publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Unknown to Bolyai, Gauss held him in high regard, calling him "a genius of the first order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Spherical Geometry

Another familiar example of a non-Euclidean geometry is spherical geometry, as we live on a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. In spherical geometry, straight lines are parts of great circles (the largest possible circles on a sphere, like the equator or lines of longitude on Earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Any two great circles will always intersect, meaning there are no parallel lines on a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

Initially, spherical geometry was not considered [[NonEuclidean Geometries and Jnos Bolyai | non-Euclidean geometry]] because lines on a sphere cannot be extended indefinitely, violating Euclid's second postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. However, in 1854, Riemann generalized the second postulate from "infinite extension" to "unbounded," allowing spherical geometry to be recognized as a valid non-Euclidean geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. With this change, spherical (or elliptic) geometry could be derived by using the generalized four postulates and assuming no parallel lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## Modern Implications: Understanding Our Universe

### Einstein's General Relativity

The development of [[NonEuclidean Geometries and Jnos Bolyai | non-Euclidean geometries]] proved crucial for understanding our universe. In 1905, Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity, based on two postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>:
1.  The laws of physics are the same in all [[Inertial observers and equivalence principle | inertial frames of reference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
2.  The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all [[Inertial observers and equivalence principle | inertial observers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

This made space and time relative, creating a problem for Newtonian gravity, where the force of gravity depends on a distance that is no longer well-defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Einstein sought to reconcile relativity and gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

In 1907, Einstein had his "happiest thought" by realizing that a man in free fall experiences weightlessness, similar to being in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. This led to the equivalence principle: there is no experiment to distinguish between free fall in a uniform gravitational field and being in deep space not near massive objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Therefore, the free-falling man is an [[Inertial observers and equivalence principle | inertial observer]], not accelerating and not experiencing gravity as a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

If gravity isn't a force, why do objects like the space station orbit Earth? Astronauts in the space station also feel weightless, moving as if at constant velocity in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. This is because they *are* traveling in a straight line, but the spacetime itself is curved by massive objects like Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Objects moving through curved spacetime follow the shortest path, a geodesic, making their "straight" motion appear curved to a distant observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

This understanding of straight lines in curved geometries is fundamental to general relativity and our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. General relativity has been remarkably successful, with countless findings supporting its predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

### Observational Evidence of Curved Spacetime

*   **Gravitational Lensing**: In 2014, astronomers observed the same supernova in four different places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. This was due to a massive galaxy between the supernova and Earth, which curved spacetime, causing light to travel multiple paths to reach us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. The galaxy acted as a gravitational lens, and based on this, astronomers accurately predicted a replay of the supernova a year later in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
*   **Gravitational Waves**: We can now measure ripples in spacetime itself, known as gravitational waves, formed by cosmic events like merging black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. A recent survey by NANOGrav suggests the fabric of spacetime is "buzzing" with remnants of grand cosmic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

### The Shape of the Universe

[[NonEuclidean Geometries and Jnos Bolyai | Non-Euclidean geometries]] also allow us to determine the overall shape of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>:
*   In flat geometry, triangle angles sum to 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   In spherical geometry, angles sum to more than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   In hyperbolic geometry, angles sum to less than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

Gauss attempted to measure the angles of a large triangle formed by three mountains, finding 180 degrees within observational error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. However, this triangle was far too small relative to the universe's size to detect curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

To overcome this scale issue, astronomers measure the largest possible triangles using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the first light from when the universe was 380,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. By analyzing slight temperature variations in the CMB, astronomers predict expected spot sizes if the universe is flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Shifts in these predicted sizes would indicate spherical or hyperbolic geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Data from the Planck mission shows that the universe is almost exactly flat, with a curvature of 0.0007 ± 0.0019, essentially zero within the margin of error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

This flatness is remarkably serendipitous, as even a small difference in the universe's average mass-energy density (e.g., one more or one less hydrogen atom per cubic meter) would result in a curved (spherical or hyperbolic) universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. The reason for this precise density is still unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

## Euclid's "Mistake" and Undefined Terms

While Euclid was correct to include the fifth postulate, his true "mistake" lay in his initial definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Concepts like "point," "line," and "breadthless length" are difficult to define without infinite recursion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Modern mathematics addresses this by using *undefined terms*, focusing instead on the *relationships* between objects as described by postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

This approach allows for different interpretations of "point," "line," and "plane" within the same axiomatic system. For example, in spherical geometry, "line" means a great circle, and "plane" means a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. In hyperbolic geometry, a "plane" can be represented by a disk, and "straight lines" are arcs of circles orthogonal to the disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

Ultimately, geometry can be viewed as a game:
*   The first four postulates are the minimum rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   The fifth postulate selects the world:
    *   No parallel lines leads to spherical geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
    *   One parallel line leads to flat (Euclidean) geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
    *   More than one parallel line leads to hyperbolic geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

In 1854, Riemann advanced this concept by laying groundwork for a geometry where curvature could differ from place to place and extend to higher dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami unequivocally proved that hyperbolic and spherical geometries were just as consistent as Euclidean flat geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

The development of these "paradoxical and seemingly absurd geometries," spurred by over 2,000 years of thought on a single sentence in Euclid's "Elements," has proven to be at the very heart of our best physical theories of reality, especially general relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
