From: [[alexhormozi]] <br/> 

Everyone is always "one decision away from changing our lives forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. If previous decisions have led to an undesirable current state, they were "not good decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. To gain more power in life, it's crucial to understand what power is and how to unlock it through actions and [[decision_making_and_risk_taking | decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This applies to influencing others in business or making [[effective_decisionmaking_and_the_importance_of_listening | decisions]] that improve one's own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Speaker's Journey
The speaker, who owns Acquisition.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, shared that ten years ago, he was "sleeping on a gym floor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. His life has since "gone significantly better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> due to a series of events and [[decision_making_and_risk_taking | decisions]] that made "massive differences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. After a speech on this topic, hundreds of people reported taking "huge strides" in their lives and becoming "more powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Defining Power
Power, in this context, is defined as "the ability to influence or direct events or people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. It is a neutral force that "amplifies who we are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. If one is a "shitty person," power makes them "very very shitty," but if they are "very good," it makes them "very very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The aspiration should be to have more power in our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Decision Making in Sales
The speaker's approach to sales is primarily "logical selling," focusing on "selling with logic to make lots of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The goal in sales is not just to get a "yes I'm going to buy," but "yes I'm going to decide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This approach aims to empower the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Emotional buyers may get excited and buy, but "when the emotions fade, the logic will continue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, leading to a "great customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Key Beliefs About Selling and Decision-Making
The speaker outlined several beliefs that have been instrumental in his success:
1.  **People want to believe you** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>: Help their logical brains justify decisions they already want to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
2.  **Selling happens before you ask for the sale** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>: Closing happens after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
3.  **It's easier to handle obstacles than objections** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>: Obstacles occur before the sale is solicited, while objections are disagreements after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
4.  **Expect and plan for "no"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>: "No is the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> because if they could decide on their own, they wouldn't need help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
5.  **If you didn't get a gasp from a price tag, you didn't go high enough** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>: A higher initial price can set a "beautiful price anchor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
6.  **Selling properly is the first step to becoming a coach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>: It sets expectations and dictates the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
7.  **Selling is helping prospects make decisions for themselves** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>: It's about empowering them to help themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
8.  **Keep the prospect, not the sale, as the priority** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>: Magnify them, not yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
9.  **Seek to understand, not to argue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>: Approach with "childlike curiosity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> when a prospect objects.
10. **Closing is a dance, not a fight** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>: The goal is not to "beat them into submission" but to help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
11. **Selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>: You must believe and have trust to transfer belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
12. **You can only build trust if you generally want to help** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>: Humans are good at sniffing out intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
13. **Belief and trust are a continuum, not binaries** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>: It's about how deeply one believes or trusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
14. **Closers ask hard questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>: This is because they genuinely care and aim for transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
15. **The person who cares the most about the prospect wins the sale** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>: This includes caring more about their well-being than they do themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
16. **Record all your sales calls** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>: This helps analyze successes and train new team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
17. **Power is the ability to direct or influence people** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>: Understanding this skill is crucial to being powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

### The Power of Closing
Closing, or everything you do after asking someone to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, is a high predictor of business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Just like in the NFL, where top red zone offenses (those who close) make the playoffs 90% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, the ability to close can compensate for many deficiencies in other areas of life and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The focus is on the "middle 80%" of prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> – those who don't always buy and don't always say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

## Sources of Powerlessness: The Onion of Blame
People often cast their power to "sources outside of our control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, which are essentially "distortions of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. Based on Dr. Albert Ellis's work on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>, these distortions fall into three core categories:
1.  **Circumstances**: "I must get what I want when I want it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
2.  **Others**: "Other people must treat me fairly and kindly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
3.  **Self**: "I must do well or else I am no good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

These manifest as an "onion of blame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>:
*   **Outer Layer**: Blaming circumstances (time, money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
*   **Middle Layer**: Blaming other people (spouse, kids, employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.
*   **Core Layer**: Blaming oneself ("it's me, it's my fault") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

The goal is to peel back these layers to get to the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

### Five Common Excuses (Manifestations of Distortions)
These core distortions manifest in five common excuses or "scapegoats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>:

#### 1. Time ("Not a good time," "too busy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>
*   **Macro (Busy Season)**: If you want long-term success and will be busy in the future, it's best to start now. Learning when busy means you can sustain it forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   **Micro (No Time in Day)**: People often waste time on unproductive activities. It's not about *adding* more to your plate, but *removing* what isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Jeff Bezos has the same amount of time as everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
*   **"When Then" Fallacy**: The belief "when I have X, then I will do Y" flips the sequence. For example, "I'll start saving money once I'm rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. This is a distortion, not reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

#### 2. Value/Price/Money ("Can't afford it," "too expensive") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>
*   **Why a Lot is Good**: If it's a lot of money to you, it means you'll be "all in" and have a higher likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   **Why it's Not a Lot (Relatively)**: Compare the cost to the potential value. If an investment adds $10,000/month or helps achieve a major life goal, it's worth it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **What's Money Good For?**: You're going to spend the money anyway. The question is whether you'll spend it on things that don't get you anywhere, or on things that help you grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. You pay either with money or with time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>.
*   **Resourceful, Not Resources**: Self-made millionaires and billionaires started with nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. People have the ability to be resourceful when needed, especially for others, so they should apply that to themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

#### 3. Fit ("Not sure if it's for me") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>
*   **New Identity, New Priorities**: What you spend money and time on reveals your priorities and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. To achieve new goals, one must step into a new identity with new priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.
*   **Change the Change**: What you've been doing has led to your current results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>. To change, you must change your actions. The question is whether "the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.
*   **Hypothetical**: Ask: "If this were perfect, would you do it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a> If yes, then address what's different. If no, then the issue is likely trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

#### 4. Authority ("Have to talk to my partner/spouse") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>
*   **Support, Not Permission**: If your partner supports your struggle, they should support a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. If the roles were reversed, you'd support them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
*   **Taking Ownership**: Asking for permission gives away your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. Not owning your decision can lead to resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. Doctors go to medical school, lawyers to law school, but entrepreneurs lack a formal school; they learn from others' accumulated experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.

#### 5. Avoidance/Stall ("I need to think about it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>
*   **Past**: This isn't a fast decision; you've been making it for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. Don't let a past bad investment or experience "burn you twice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a> by preventing a good one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Don't be "tired of another year of almost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>; calculate "the cost of inaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.
*   **Present**: "It doesn't take information to make decisions, it takes information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. If you are the sole source of information, waiting won't help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>. To make a decision, a prospect must believe three things:
    1.  The product/service will achieve the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
    2.  You will fulfill your word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>.
    3.  It will work for *them* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>.
    Once these are affirmed, the only remaining question is access to the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. An "informed decision" can often only be made once inside the program, which is why guarantees are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.
*   **Future**: Magnify the pain of continued inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. Compare options: doing the thing and getting results, or not doing it and staying stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>. If you're going to fix your problem eventually, "you might as well start fixing it now" to enjoy benefits sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. The question is not about perfection, but if a decision will get you "closer or further from your goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.

### Bonus Overcome: "The Reason You Are Telling Yourself Not To Do This Is The Reason You Do It" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>
The very reason someone is holding themselves back (e.g., "I can't afford this," "I don't have time," "I'm dependent on my spouse") is often the biggest chain holding them back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. Breaking that chain returns power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.

[[Decision_making_and_risk_taking | Fortunes are created by taking a lot of risk with a little bit of money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>. The speaker emphasized that everything he has achieved is a result of [[the_role_of_longterm_investment_in_personal_growth | investing in his own education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This has yielded "far higher returns than any stock, any real estate, any crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. [[Investing in personal growth and mentorship | Buying experience and skills]] cannot be taken away by governments, divorce, or any external force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.

The "time tax of ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a> is the number one tax no one respects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. Not knowing how to achieve a goal (e.g., making a million dollars a year) is actively costing that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. The goal is to pay down this "time tax of ignorance as fast as humanly possible" by [[investing_in_personal_growth_and_mentorship | educating and investing in oneself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>, specifically in experiences that [[developing_skills_and_finding_better_job_opportunities | build skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, "superman is not coming; it's just you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. Every decision is a vote for or against the person you want to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>. Rapid progress comes from "buying time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a> – by buying the time it took others to make mistakes and learn lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>.

There are "no silver bullets" and "no program is going to save your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>, but some things can move you closer to your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. When rare opportunities arise, take them, because "either you win or you learn, and both of those get you closer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. The speaker's personal journey, starting with no money and investing in a $10,000 mastermind without a gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:08">[01:22:08]</a>, put him on the right path towards success, demonstrating the power of a single, committed decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.
